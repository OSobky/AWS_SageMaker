0,I love everything about my fire tv. I wish I wouldve gotten one sooner!,POSITIVE
1,"My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made .",POSITIVE
2,"I've bought 2 of these tablets now for my kids, they're a great value for its low price. Great screen quality, everything you need in a tablet and good size. Very happy with them.",POSITIVE
3,Bought one for each of my kids and they love it. Functionally sound product very easy to use.,POSITIVE
4,"I picked this up on Black Friday when it was $30. It seemed like the parental controls would make it good for my kids. I'm not sold. While I can sideload the Google Play store, you can't access anything you download from the safety of the child's account. In addition, 8 GB is practically useless.",NEGATIVE
5,i mean if you want just a tablet to read some books and browse internet thats fine.,NEUTRAL
6,For the price you pay and to do basic functions this table is well worth the money.,POSITIVE
7,I love it. Use it daily for everything. Love the options and looks.,POSITIVE
8,"I bought this tablet for my daughter to watch movies on & play educational games. It takes some time getting used to Amazon's Apps, But so far so good! It gets 4 stars bc the Camara takes terrible pictures.",POSITIVE
9,My nephew always uses my sister's iphone when watching videos. He loves his youtube videos lol. So I went out and bought him this. The kid loves it. There's value in the cartoon membership also,POSITIVE
10,This is the best Fire they have come out with so far.,POSITIVE
11,I'm very accustomed to using verbal commands with my Samsung Galaxy... Same experience,NEUTRAL
12,Fast response time from unit. Works great. Easy to use. Enjoy watching the device.,POSITIVE
13,I bought the Amazon Fire TV to mod and stream media. It works fantastic and does exactly what I want including 4k video output. The primary reason I chose this item over the Fire stick was that I wanted wired ethernet and not wireless. Picture quality and sound is excellent.,POSITIVE
14,"The Fire tablet is great, especially for the price! And if you are an Amazon Prime member, it's even better. You can read books for free using Amazon's Lending Library and watch Prime videos for free too. You can even get Google Play Store and download apps (just Google it) on the Fire. Make sure you get a micro SD card right away, because the 8GB internal storage fills up very quickly.",POSITIVE
15,"I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phones can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.). It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the question So basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio. Come on Amazon!!!",NEGATIVE
16,I bought this tablet for my 10 yo granddaughter and she loves it.,POSITIVE
17,Awesome little machine...kids talk to it everyday five times a day!!,POSITIVE

20,Use every day. So easy to use. Perfect size. Will be great when traveling. Love it.,POSITIVE
21,"The product overall is great. I got it as a Christmas present for my mom and she loved it.The only problem I had was with ordering. I was unexpected put on backorder when a Best Buy employee had stated and showed me I would receive the product the Tuesday after Christmas. Fortunately, I found the product in another Best Buy store and canceled my back order of the product. Great product overall, but 4 stars from me because this was the first time Best Buy ever let me down like that so I hope it doesn't happen again.",MIXED
22,Bought this for all four of my children and they loved it.,POSITIVE
23,Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.,MIXED
24,Page turner. I would have given 5 stars. A little disappointed with the ending.,MIXED
25,"This is without a doubt the best Streaming Device on the market. Like the fire stick, I have also purchased many of these devices for friends and family (the ones i like more obviously because of the higher price), And I have had zero issues with any of them. These are capable of doing everything you want them to do just like the fire stick, but better and faster, and possibly in 4k if you have the content and technology to support it.",POSITIVE
26,"This is way to complicated for kids, my kid was frustrated trying to figure it out",NEGATIVE
27,It basically makes any old TV a smart tv. It is also 4K UHD. That is one of the biggest pluses on top of me having Amazon Prime already.,POSITIVE
28,Purchased this for my son for organization purposes which ended up becoming the family personal assistant. Love the apps and the capabilities this nifty gadget has.,POSITIVE
29,"Got this for a present for someone, and they love it. They really wanted an e reader not a tablet and that's why he loves it.",POSITIVE
30,"perfect for kids. reading, internet, Netflix, and games",POSITIVE
31,I tried a few Samsung tables they were junk and I paid 4 times the price for those. this out preformed them 10 fold and was 1/4 of the cost. Still not quite an iPad but for the price there is probably nothing better. Free time for the kids is a great feature.,MIXED
32,It does what it's supposed to do very minimal freezing second or two on occasion,POSITIVE
33,Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!,POSITIVE
34,Ordering from Amazon is simpler than ever. Use this in any room for sound as well when you aren't making an order.,POSITIVE
35,"great fun and great tool. Electronics are sometimes confusing, but not Alexia.",MIXED
36,Works fine. Alittle pricy. Kindle without is not good.,MIXED

42,I love this device. I won't have to worry about cable anymore.,POSITIVE
43,Best box. Really like it so far and having 4 k is nice,POSITIVE
44,"Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service.....",POSITIVE
45,"The Fire TV is great for Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime streaming! Fast OS, great remote and has Alexa integration.",POSITIVE
46,Great for beginners I like reading on the beach and I like to read in the shade that it works and it works great,POSITIVE
47,I am enjoying using the new and growing features of Alexa. I wish that it wouldn't suddenly turn on for no reason (even in a quiet room). It seems like it's monitoring me. Uncomfortable.,MIXED
48,I bought this for my son and one for my son-in-law. They are mesmerized by all that the Echo is capable of doing. (I want one!),POSITIVE
49,"I bought the Amazon Firebox so I could finally get rid of cable. when I think of all the $$ I will save on cable I may buy another one for 2nd tv. A bit challenging learning how to operate it, Once I do I know I will love it. Thanks Amazon",POSITIVE

53,The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!,POSITIVE
54,This tablet is fantastic for the price. It's as good or better than my first fire. The only differences are this one has only 8 gb's of storage but has front and rear cameras. It runs as fast as the other and the resolution is as good.,POSITIVE
55,"Like the function as a Prime member - easy access to prime movies, books, etc.Its a tad slow - and every time you turn it on or unlock theres an Ad. Oh well",MIXED
56,Great and inexpensive tablet which meets all my needs and expectations.,POSITIVE

63,This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.,POSITIVE
64,"I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price.",POSITIVE

66,got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied,POSITIVE
67,"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet.",MIXED
68,This is convenient and easy to operate. Love the shopping list - adding to the list without physically moving ---- and NO paper list to lose!!,POSITIVE
69,"bought for my friends, but good enough! why need so many comments?",POSITIVE
70,It's nice but there are too many specific lines to remember to get her to talk to you. Also your family gmail calendar does NOT connect if on iCloud with iPhones so she will not know your families calendar. Needs updates and she should be able to answer you by a question and not a specific way you must say things with the skills,MIXED
71,I use it for audiobooks a lot of the time . It has a good clear sound. Very easy to download books from the library .The battery seems to last a reasonable amount of time.,POSITIVE

77,"Now I will admit I am a tech gal. I did do some investigations before buying. I was not dissapointed at all. This is like your own personal assistant. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, spell,set alarm,check weather,traffic,news update,even tells jokes. I love the fact that anyone can talk to it and it will still work. My family and friends have pure entertainment with this neat gadget. I look forward to seeing more things added to the commands. Also was super easy to set up and the volume is way better than expected.",POSITIVE
78,I love having all of my streaming videos in one place and log on his single remote!,POSITIVE

82,You get what you pay for. No complains............,POSITIVE
83,"OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS.

91,I had just about every android box out there and this is my favorite. I hate the fire stick but love this.if you want something that works great get this.,POSITIVE
92,"I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again.",NEGATIVE

118,"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",MIXED
119,"Love the amount of apps on this thing. Love that I can watch anything with Bluetooth headset while I'm cleaning. I love the speak to commend. However, I wish you can request more than one route for traffic reports. My husband and I travel to different locations everyday.",MIXED

132,"I love this thing. It gets used all the time in our house. It is so versatile and has so many possible connections. Only thing is, be prepared to spend more money on other things to pair with it.",POSITIVE

154,Bought it for my nephew for an upgrade and he enjoyed it more.,POSITIVE
155,"I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you.",NEGATIVE

163,Great Deal for An Entry Amazon tablet. Unbeatable entry level tablet for use in the Amazon eco system.,POSITIVE
164,"I have been reading on a paperwhite for a few years now. When it got damaged I just went right out and bought another. It's light, easy to see without my reading glasses, since I can change the font, and it's great for reading outside, even in full sun. It's worth every penny.",POSITIVE

178,"I bought this tablet as a gift for my mother-in-law, who is not very tech-savvy. She already owns a laptop, but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching TV, rather than a whole laptop. She also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. I've owned a couple Amazon tablets before, so I had an idea of how they worked, and I wanted something at a low price point, so I decided on this. So far, she loves it! A couple of important points:-The low price point comes at the cost of hardware. After using my Fire HDX, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. It performed better in basic tasks (loading apps, web browsing, etc) than I expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.-As an Amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of Android, but does NOT have baked-in access to Google services (including the Google Play Store). You will be restricted to Amazon-approved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to Google services yourself. Popular apps like Netflix, Skype, and Facebook are all present, but the selection pales in comparison to native Android.",POSITIVE
179,Great great great great great great great great tablet.,POSITIVE

I have a specific eye problem with one of my eyes and find I have to read large print books and they can be difficult to find. The Kindle allows me to read EVERYTHING! I love it. And it is great indoors or out.",POSITIVE
183,I have about every single streaming player on the market. This one is not better or worse than the others. I got it only for using 3rd party apps. For that it works flawlessly! If you need a streaming device this one will fit the bill.,POSITIVE
184,Ordering from Amazon is now easier than ever. Don't be scared by the recent news hype.,POSITIVE
185,"Started with appleTV. Traded those in for Roku, wasn't happy and switched to Amazon Fire Tv. Couldn't be happier.",NEGATIVE

194,Great tablet for kids of any age. It's cheap and user friendly. You can even set controls so there is an age timer as well. It's perfect!,POSITIVE
195,Great gift for any age. Parentallocks awesome. Expandable sd slot too,POSITIVE
196,"Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload.",POSITIVE
197,I love my Amazon FireTV. Very easy to hook up! Very user friendly!,POSITIVE
198,Picked this up for my 7 year old and he picked it up faster than i did.,POSITIVE
199,One of the important reasons I purchased this was for HBO Go app which they have but does not work with Charter-Comcast. A quite large market of People affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it. What else can you not use it for I haven't found yet but Amazon has not written me back after I emailed them about this issue. Im stuck with waste of Money and will go get a Google Chrome now.,NEGATIVE
200,The product works well. Great price for the capabilities it offers.,POSITIVE
201,"Works good, easy for my kids, but wish the regular Android apps all worked.",MIXED
202,"After dropping my Kindle with a keyboard (not techie enough to know which generation it was) I did plenty of research before getting my next Kindle.I wanted a dedicated ebook as I don't want distractions when I read. Let's make this simple:I have read in sunlight and there have been no problems with glare.The automatic light makes it great for night reading.It took a while to get used to the buttons, but after my last Kindle, this was a feature I really wanted. I like them.I have read only three books on the Kindle so far and I still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what I want when I want. I am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter/book (which are features I love).Excellent reader. I would purchase again, but I can't say with any honesty that the extra $100 was worth it over the Paperwhite, but I have no experience with that model either. I do like this more than my last Kindle, so that is all that really matters.",POSITIVE
203,Love this! Always messing around and asking it questions,POSITIVE
204,"I bought both the dot and full sized echo, this has incredible sound! It is also very handy for checking the weather/morning commute and using it in the kitchen (timers, recipes, etc)",POSITIVE
205,The echo is a great gadget we use it all the time one of the best purchases we made from amazon,POSITIVE
206,Love the size and it capabilities! Was a great gift for my daughter!,POSITIVE

211,We recently bought all our grandkids a tablet to have of their own.. great tablet to play games on and educational things as well.,POSITIVE
212,Very satisfied with the size and performance and a great deal,POSITIVE
213,I have been a Kindle reader for years now but this is the first device I have used with a backlight and I have to say the eye strain is lower and the reading experience better than ever. For a pure reading device I do not know how it could be better other than lowering the price tag.,POSITIVE
214,I liked the tablet I bought its amazing works just fine thank u best buy,POSITIVE
215,We got one of these for my mother in law. She mostly plays games and looks at things online. The tablet is good for a minimal browsing and games...not for expert use.,POSITIVE

219,I like the fire tv better than the firestick because the connecting the ethernet cable helps with buffering,POSITIVE
220,interface isnt as user friendly as other brands but u get used to it.,MIXED
221,"I never had a legitimate reason for owning a tablet. I prefer watching shows and movies on my TV and I prefer reading actual books as opposed to a tablet. However, when I learned that Best Buy was selling this Amazon tablet for $34.99 on Black Friday, I knew that I had to get my hands on one. Even with the aforementioned reasons for not getting one, I couldn't argue with that price. I think it's a great starter tablet. It may not have the largest screen or HD quality but then again I don't need all of that. The quality and size of the screen are perfect for that price. 8GB may not be a lot of memory but there is also an option to get more storage via a memory card. I very much satisfied and recommend this tablet to anybody, especially those who are curious about tablets and haven't purchased on yet.",POSITIVE
222,The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that,MIXED
223,I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!,POSITIVE
224,"Great for surfing the web, books, You Tube and email so far. Love the size too .",POSITIVE
225,"I picked up this tablet, stacking some discounts and codes while on sale for $33 delivered.",NEUTRAL
226,"It's small, light and easily portable. Powerful enough for all your basic tablet needs like streaming, reading, light gaming and Internet browsing. Perfect for a child's first tablet or on-the-go use.",POSITIVE
227,"The Fire TV is easy to hookup and easy to use. Lots of apps. Alexa is fun and useful for programming questions, weather and controlling some of my smart home lights. The request would be to control TV volume on the remote.",POSITIVE
228,Got it for my daughters birthday. We all enjoyed the echo. Thinking of getting another for myself.,POSITIVE
229,Great product for a great price. Would highly recommend,POSITIVE
230,This works as described and Am very happy with it.,POSITIVE
231,everyday this thing gets better! Great speaker quality and sound. The ever growing list of commands and functions ensure lagging interest and usability!,POSITIVE
232,Great product... very reliable under various conditions garage/shed etc.,POSITIVE
233,"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat.",POSITIVE
234,Great product. Purchased for my wife to replace her fire hd. She loves the screen and the fact that it fits in her pocketbook.,POSITIVE
235,"Christmas present for husband,we both love the echo can't wait to download apps",POSITIVE
236,We bought this to download movies and books onto for a long plane ride. It worked great! Very happy with the purchase.,POSITIVE
237,"For the price, it's a decent tablet. They way they get the price down is to psuh ads to your device. You can pay $15 to get the ads removed. Overall it's a good tablet.",POSITIVE
238,"Bought this to cut the cable cord! Works better than I imagined, highly recommend it!",POSITIVE
239,"Amazon Echo is a great personal assistant. I find it more helpful than Siri on my iPhone. It can be used to set timers, work outs, and silly things like telling jokes plus much more. Also, it can be used to turn your home into a smart home which I have done with my lights. ""Alexa, turn on lights.""",POSITIVE
240,"Very limited in capabilities. I am used to using ""OK Google"" on my phone.... Alexa is nowhere near as helpful or intuitive. It's more like Siri Wish it were easier to put iTunes purchases in the Amazon library for Alexa to play. That said, I knew what I was getting. Hoping the technology improved within a couple years.",NEGATIVE
241,Very Affordable. I gave this as a gift so I am not sure how well it works.,POSITIVE
242,Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.,POSITIVE
243,Initially I bought this for my son and he's been using it everyday with a protective cover since my purchase my only issue I have really with the unit is that the charging port is in a horrible position and it's very difficult to insert the charger easily I may have a defective unit which I may have to return since the charging port is quite loose the price was right but quality could be a little better,MIXED
244,"The Echo is not cheap but provides entertainment far beyond its original cost. The longer I have it, the more uses I find. ....and it looks good.",POSITIVE
245,I got this only because the next best (full android tv) is the nvidia shield which is a little out of my price range. Amazon blocks alot of the native android features and hides some apps that are generally available in the android play store. Other than that it's a great streaming device,MIXED
246,Apple exceeds in all areas minus 4K. Tough decision but if I had to choose again I would opt for the new Apple TV.,MIXED
247,Great device to use for streaming tv shows & movie,POSITIVE
248,"For 50 dollars you cant REALLY complain, it actually will take a drop pretty well too.",POSITIVE
249,Have been reviewing this tablet on amazon for some time. Its an extra for us we keep it in the living room.,POSITIVE
250,"I like the reader, nice and small. What i don't like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home, it does not let you set it up. I had to go to my daughters house and set it up. That is a bit alarming. It should be more secure since the only way we can put items on there is by putting our information on it that can be compromised. Make it more secure and easy to put protection on it. That is the only reason I didn't make it a 5 star product.",MIXED
251,"In trying to get my son to read more and thought a kindle would help. First I got a good deal on an old kindle model that had been refurbished and it quickly broke. I had a gift card to Best Buy and this one was on sale, so I got it for him. I also bought him a silicone case and bought a Best Buy warranty. It is much easier to use this model vs the old one that he had originally, and I like that you can use FreeTime app on this device but you only just get the books. I also use overdrive to get him books from the library. So far it is working great for us. I bought this at Best Buy instead of getting it online from Amazon because I like the Best Buy warranty and that they are easier to deal with than Amazon.",MIXED
252,Very easy to use and I like the voice search. The Bluetooth headphones come in handy at night. We get to enjoy all the features with our prime account.,POSITIVE
253,Having a charger for my Kindle Paperwhite makes certain that I am charging the Kindle with the proper charging power.,NEUTRAL
254,I have more than one and am glad I ordered another. You can never have too many USB chargers.,POSITIVE

263,The amazon tables were great Christmas gift the kids love them,POSITIVE
264,I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files.

271,"This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet.",MIXED
272,"I bought this as a gift, and we all tried it out. Setup was pretty easy - download the app, connect it to your wi-fi, and you're off and running from there. Some of the potentially useful things that we saw right off the bat were:* Reading your news headlines in the morning* It feels like a voice-oriented Google search* Getting answers to random questions* Kids are easily entertained by itPersonally, I don't see the need for it - but I can appreciate the convenience and novelty of it.",POSITIVE
273,Great to have my entire library with me and no I can read in bed with the backlight also.,POSITIVE
274,"Love the tablet, just wish they had included a booklet with it and not just an on line referral. Since this is not my first tablet I was familiar with things, but for a new user, I think a booklet of some sort would be a help",MIXED
275,"The best tablet I have had! Overall its great.Great camera, tools, apps & great battery! That will last.",POSITIVE
276,I am very happy with my Amazon Fire TV. I set my 19 year old daughter to install it and she had it up and running in a matter of a couple minutes.,POSITIVE
277,"The vacation house we rented for a week this summer had an Echo Dot. We didn't know what it was until it started talking to us as we must have activated it somehow. After our shock, we found that it played music, told jokes, and was in general, fun to use. So, we we arrived home, we began exploring what the Echo could do. Wow. It is amazing. We have been Amazon Prime members for many years and this is a logical extension of the Amazon ecosystem. I think most folks who use Prime will be pleasantly surprised by what it can do. However, not everyone likes it. My son-in-law says its creepy to have something listening to you in your home. So, most folks will have to get over that. For the price, it's well worth it to explore the future of technology!",POSITIVE
278,Replaced our old kindle. Still the best for reading outdoors,POSITIVE
279,I love that is great for kids and the parents can monitor it. The kids love it too.,POSITIVE

293,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother. I already owned a Kindle Paperwhite and knew that it would be perfect for her. It is lightweight and easy to hold; lit from behind so no glare (easy on the eyes); and the font size can be easily adjusted. A charge lasts for a week or more. With a Kindle you can carry an entire library of books with you. The Paperwhite easily slips into a purse or large coat pocket, so you are never without a book whether you are traveling or waiting for someone. I was right about my mom; she was thrilled to receive her Kindle, and at 86 she is excited about using new technnology.",POSITIVE

300,"This is the first Kindle I buy and I was hoping to be a good experience which so far has been. You may not treat this device as a limited tablet since it is not. It's a reader that works just fine for that. If you compare it you'll feel it lacks speed or responsiveness, but remember that this is just a reader and it works fine for that purpose. The extra feature, the backlight, works pretty fine even at dark rooms without leaving you blind.",POSITIVE
301,"Bought this for my 3 year old and she loves it, it's perfect for her and if it breaks it wasn't an expensive device! Well worth it",POSITIVE

304,"I purchased it to see if the stream speed would be quicker than my Amazon Firestick but was disappointed.The stream speed is at the mercy of your internet provider.The processing speed is faster than the Firestick but in the end it has the same memory as the Firestick.For the price, the Amazon Firestick is better if all you do is stream... It might be a good fit for gamers.",MIXED
305,"I first bought the Kindle Paperwhite with the 300dpi screen, I didn't think the jump to the Voyage was worth the $80 plus additional taxes. I read about the Voyage and with Georgia having the back to school tax free days and the e-readers qualifying I returned the Paperwhite and purchased this one. Boy am I glad I did.",POSITIVE
306,"Great media player for watching movies and shows from netflix,hulu, etc. easy to navigate, quick quad core cpu keeps things from lagging, and voice commands via the voice remote make this a winner.",POSITIVE

320,"After reading the reviews I was very skeptical. I mainly use Apple products, but with 5 kids and apple out of my price range this was perfect. I was able to get 4 tablets for the price of 1 Apple iPad. The kids love and they don't mind the commercial.

322,Bought this tablet as a gift and I might end up buying one for myself.,POSITIVE
323,"I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps.",MIXED

333,"If you aren't tech savvy, know someone who is to be able to get Alexa to respond. Amazon was kind enough to email me to offer support; I'm afraid the first question will be, ""Is it plugged in?"" I'm not tech savvy, but I also have some sense.",POSITIVE
334,Bought this for my son who is in college. He has most of his class books online and wanted this tablet to read his course books versus having to tote around his laptop all the time. He uses it almost exclusively and loves the small light option to carrying his laptop all the time.,POSITIVE

345,"I researched several streaming devices but because of my experience with Amazon Kindle Fire and the reviews read for the Fire TV I decided to do the Amazon Fire TV. Set up was easy (the hardest part was opening the remote to put the batteries in!). Once everything was hooked up, the instructions and tips video really helped get everything started. The only negative I will say is that this product did not include the HDMI cable (other brands did) but that was explained on the box and by the sales associate. I enjoyed this so much that I ordered the TV Stick for my bedroom TV. (And have recommended this product to friends and co-workers.)",MIXED
346,"This is a very good tablet for use with streaming. It does lack some apps like youtube however, since it isn't connected to the google play store.

There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help.",POSITIVE

My daugther loves it and so do I. On kidz mode I can rest assured that she is only going to see kids safe content like interactive book, games and apps. On tablet mode she can watch movies with the SD card slot which can go all they way to 128GB!I put a 32 GB which help us on our loooong christmas trip...",POSITIVE
354,"Amazon Tap is a great device. The device has very good audio quality despite it's small size. The biggest difference between this and the larger Amazon Echo, is that you have to press the ""microphone"" button before the device will listen to you (which is great for people who are concerned that the Echo is always listening to what you say). So far, the battery life has been great. With the Alexa app, it is very easy to connect this device to different Wi-Fi networks.",POSITIVE

360,I bought this tablet mostly because the price was extremely affordable. I like that it's easy to use and set up easily to my Amazon account and all my books.,POSITIVE
361,"I own a Chromecast and didn't think I would need this. How wrong I was! The Amazon Fire TV box is more functional and useful than the Chromecast. It is easy to travel with and as long as you have a solid Internet connection (wired or wireless), you can enjoy this device. This was a great purchase and I highly recommend it! So nice I bought it twice!",POSITIVE

364,This was bought for toys for tots. Everyone always buys for the younger kids but forget that here are pre-teens and teenagers too!,POSITIVE
365,"Amazon products amaze me for the value of what they are. This is no different. A great little 7 inch tablet where you can surf the web, watch movies, read books, or listen to music. Only really works if you have Amazon Prime. This really unlocks the potential. To really unlock the potential you can also subscribe to kindle reading unlimited if you read a lot or have several people in the family that will also read. I actually opted to return this one to upgrade to the Fire HD8 which was only about $20 more at the time and gives you a slightly bigger screen and HD resolution (I love to stream movies).",POSITIVE

386,"This is the first time that I've used a Kindle tablet. I've used Android and Apple devices before, and this is a different beast. People that are used to an Android experience, will not be thrilled with this device. Even though it looks like Android, the Play Store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the Kindle Store. If I had to do it all over again I'd spend an extra $50 or $60 and get an actual Android tablet.",NEGATIVE
387,Simple easy to use. Plug and play so to speak. You should read the manual that comes installed on it. Can read anywhere with no glare at all. tt even has a browser for the web that is in the preliminary stages but it is pretty good.,POSITIVE
388,"The simple set up, ease of use, and features of the Echo make it a cool little device to have around the house.",POSITIVE
389,This is my 3rd Kindle e-reader and it's the best yet. Text is clear and device is light. Considered the newer Voyage and Oasis but I believe this is a better deal. It was worth the upgrade from the prior Paperwhite.,POSITIVE
390,"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the Helpful button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this. Thanks!",POSITIVE
391,The fridge started to work earlier than indicated in the brochure,NEGATIVE

418,My wife has enjoyed this tablet a lot. She plays a lot of card games and looks up recipe.,POSITIVE
419,"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!",POSITIVE
420,This item makes a great gift. It's small and very affordable compared to other 7 inch tablets. Navigating the tablet and closing apps are a bit of a learning curve.,POSITIVE

436,Works just like it says it does. Would recomend this to anybody!,POSITIVE
437,"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing.",POSITIVE

440,Can't believe how smooth it works.Highly recommend it.,POSITIVE
441,"You really can't go too wrong with this purchase because of the price. Works very well, but don't expect iPad quality. Does everything I've asked of it, but some web pages are harder to read partially because of it's small size (which can be handy) and it's lower resolution. It's a good second tablet and is better watching a movie on, then a smaller phone. Can throw it in a small travel bag and not feel you have to be quite so careful with it as you might be with a more expensive tablet.",MIXED
442,Great music and. Fun to test her knowledge. Amazing how qickly she responds to any question. Cannot stump her.,POSITIVE
443,"My daughter loves playing with Alexa, from math problems to telling jokes and inter acting with most of the comments you may have.

The design also blended in in my kitchen very well and i have replaced my old bluetooth speaker with it. So much potential with this device.",POSITIVE
444,"Tablets can get expensive, this one is pretty much everything you want in a tablet, but not for an outrageous price. Being Amazon, they make it user-friendly as long as you know what apps to get.",MIXED

457,"We have a couple of these now for our kids. Create a kid account and allow access to a few apps, add a memory card for more storage for movie video files that you have and it's enough to entertain the kids on car trips or keep them from going nuts in restaurants occasionally.",POSITIVE
458,"Already own 2 Roku's. Purchased 2 Fire TV's and found the performance and usability very good. Replaced Cable TV withe them parred with PlayStation Vue Core Slim.

486,"The Paperwhite makes it possible to condense a lot of books in one small device, thereby saving your house from looking like a warehouse. You can pack a lot of books into your suitcase with a Paperwhite. If your device gets stolen, lost or trashed, you may lose a substantial portion (or all) of your personal library. The Paper white allows you to increase size of print Big Advantage. Use of hand gestures to turn page allows faster reading. It's awkward to hold, lying in bed. An attachable gripper would be helpful to hold and read at same time",POSITIVE
487,I can't seem to be able to hook it up with my internet connection. I will be returning it to the store.,NEGATIVE
488,This model has an excellent screen resolution and size. Very easy to use and navigate the functions. Web browser works great.

494,It was easy to setup and fun to interact with Alexa.,POSITIVE
495,I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!,POSITIVE

510,"He loves to read, play games and watch movies. Great purchase",POSITIVE
511,I bought this for my toddler to keep her busy on road trips or at appointments and she wasn't too fond of it. It's kinda slow and limited to what you can do. One feature I did like is that you can set a profile for kids and they'll only be able to use apps that you designate for them to use.,MIXED
512,"I purchased this tablet for my 2 year old niece, and it works great, no issues at all, she mainly uses it to watch barney and Elmo episodes... easy to setup parental controls for safety... easy to handle especially for a child, very small and lightweight... recommend to all",POSITIVE

536,"This item was a replacement for a misplaced/lost Kindle Voyage. It is my go-to eReader, compact, light-weight, and read anywhere (bright sun, shade, at nite) device. The Kindle Paperwhite could have been equally useful, but I was spoiled with the Voyage. As a note, I also have an iPadMini and an iPad Air2, but they are much heavier to lug around.",POSITIVE
537,Absolutely LOVE my Echo! Sound is much louder than I expected it to be so it's very easy to hear!! Great for playing music and she'll play anything you want to hear!! The shopping list feature is awesome and the fact that it goes right to my phone so I can check it at the store is great!! Highly recommend!!,POSITIVE
538,Nice product and a good companion for anyone who need to be entertained.,POSITIVE

542,"it does what its supposed to do, turn ur tv into a smart tv altho chromecast has the upper hand because of its lack or chuggy connection to mobile phone",POSITIVE
543,"The Amazon fire TV is a simple to install and use as advertised. All you need is your own HDMI cable and everything else is provided for you. Set up took minutes. I really like how fast the Fire TV is. I use it almost exclusively for Netflix, Hulu, and live TV streaming thru PlayStation Vue. I chose the Fire TV over the TV stick because the Fire TV has a faster processor and it works beautifully. I would definitely recommend this box for anyone who's looking to cut the cord from cable.",POSITIVE
544,The battery life had been incredible. Fits in my wife's hands comfortably. She can't wait to get her next book.,POSITIVE
545,I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.,NEGATIVE

557,"We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry.",POSITIVE
558,This product works the same as the firestick but is suppose to have 4K and better quality. To be honest it looks the same on our 70 inch 4K tv. This product does not come with the cords to hook it up. So you need to buy an hdmi cord and an Ethernet cord which adds to the cost. But I do love the Amazon product compared to other devices.,MIXED

579,"I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!",POSITIVE

593,It works great for a kids tablet and the best is that you could add extra memory to it by adding a SD card.,POSITIVE
594,It's an amazing product. Use it daily. Can't wait for updates,POSITIVE
595,I eventually had to return it because of the shades of yellow in the back-light when using it at night. It was okay at day time but at night during which I usually read it was not what i expected to be premium cost product. Especially it was very annoying to read in the landscape mode. I guess Amazon needs a better QA department.,NEGATIVE

598,My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.,POSITIVE
599,"I bought this after being an avid Apple fan for the last 10 years. I had old style two Apple TV's and even bought a new Apple TV to help with me cutting the cord to DirectTV after 11 years. I switch to using the Apple TV with the DirecTV Now streaming service. After the Apple TV would no longer let friends or family airplay to it because of new updates or let me load any third party apps I knew it was time to switch. It was a great switch to the Fire TV and I have not looked back. I have been able to load numerous apps that are not available on the Apple TV such as Showbox and Kodi. My biggest complaint was the Fire TV remote was not able to control the volume on my sound bar like the Apple TV remote and was not able to turn my TV or sound bar on or off. The Sideclick remote was exactly what I needed. I was able to program the remote to control power and sound level, along with change the input on the TV. I would highly recommend using the Fire TV.Pros:Works extremely wellAllows 3rd party app installationMuch cheaper than Apple TVAllows use of amazon music which Apple TV did notCons:Home page is not at visually pleasing as the Apple TVRemote does not have volume controlsRemote is not touch sensitive and has a very loud *click* noise when pushing buttons.",POSITIVE

602,"Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work.",POSITIVE
603,"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?",POSITIVE
604,Glad that I get to control the time spent on which sure site and apps.,POSITIVE
605,"So many ways to use this. Easy, fun, and helpful to have around.",POSITIVE
606,"It may not be a speed demon, but this tablet runs very well and the Fire OS is easy to navigate and use. I'm taking off one star due to some annoying limitations like the fact that the OS makes you use its own browser at all times, but overall it's a smart buy if you want to test a tablet out!",MIXED
607,"The Amazon Fire TV box hooks to cable modem easily and is very user-friendly. Great for Amazon Prime members. The only issue is that there is not enough 4K content out there and, in my opinion, does not warrant the price as opposed to the more portable Amazon Fire TV stick. Yes, the box has a faster processor and more RAM than the stick, but for content, I've had NO PROBLEM with the stick and it's cheaper.",MIXED
608,Works Great! Love the screen sharpness. Very easy to use.,POSITIVE

617,Good and smooth speed. Long battery with quick charge,POSITIVE
618,"Great for reading, watching movies, using on the go",POSITIVE
619,"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can).",POSITIVE
620,Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.,MIXED
621,It worked perfectly!!,POSITIVE

623,My granddaughter really loves it. She was so anxious to start using it.,POSITIVE
624,"Very cool device in general, and becomes even more convenient with every smart device you add to this system. I think the Google Home is smarter, but it's cooler to say, ""Alexa..."" vs. ""Ok/Hey Google...""",POSITIVE
625,Nothing fancy. A good budget tablet that does what It suppose to do,MIXED
626,I enjoy this tablet. Since I am an Amazon customer it was fairly easy to set up once I entered my amazon ID.,POSITIVE

642,Best purchases I've made when it comes to items for reading. Battery lasts for days and weeks. The lighting source is awesome and adjustable. I recommend this to everyone who wants to have a book on the go but not carry anything too heavy.,POSITIVE
643,"I had to replace my Kindle 3G keyboard after several years because it would no longer charge. So I got this one and I'm satisfied, but I really miss my 3G. The only feature that's better in the newer Kindle is the light. Turning pages is my main complaint with the touch screen. It sometimes doesn't register the touch and you have to do it again. Also going back a page is a pain. Supposedly the left 25% of the screen is for going back, but it seems like the left 10% at best and just to be safe I press on the very edge. I miss the buttons for turning pages.I also miss the 3G even though I didn't use it all that often. Now I just need to make sure I plan ahead on road trips.",NEGATIVE
644,This is the kindle to buy. Great resolution and a backlight is great. The higher end Kindle's don't justify the price difference. Use it all time time and love it.,POSITIVE

646,For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.,POSITIVE
647,The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...,POSITIVE

I don't have the newest Apple TV, so I can't comment on that product, but this one is fast and has a couple of key buttons on the remote that make navigating easier than my apple. I also love the 4K content streaming perfectly!",POSITIVE
650,Kindle has nailed it when it comes to tablets. They are affordable and efficicient for the money.,POSITIVE
651,"Good tablet for the price. Has all features needed. Typing was difficult, but using a stylus fixed those issues. Has enough technology built into it that it won't be obsolete in a few months like some of the off brand stuff.",POSITIVE
652,Had an earlier version of the kindle but found the paperwhite was much better - the ability to adjust the brightness of screen is a great feature - would recommend this to all - Even if you have a kindle,POSITIVE

668,This is a great centerpiece for your smart home. Has the ability to control so many devices with more abilities coming. Also has an impressive speaker for such a small device.,POSITIVE
669,"It is hard to beat this box. It is fast, has hardware acceleration for H264 and H265 (up to 4k) video, so it doesn't stutter, even with the highest quality videos. Android based OS easily sideloads apps like Kodi (SPMC) and Firefox browser. The remote is comfortable to use and is actually much easier to use than the current Apple TV (4th gen) remote. Having a microSDHC slot makes up for the dismal 8GB of internal storage. USB slot makes use of a standard wireless keyboard easy. I wish the homepage was more organized/customizeable like the AppleTV, but the apps and hardware itself is every bit as good IMO.",POSITIVE
670,"We use our Echo to control our interior lighting, as well as to set a timer , playing music, getting the weather, and general information. Oh, and the shopping list is a great feature!",POSITIVE

672,"Alexa WRECKS Siri...faster, smarter, and understands complex questions. Picture it this way, who would you rather receive an answer from: A high-schooler or a pre-schooler. That's the difference. No, really. When Best Buy puts this on sale for $139 - grab one! Setup is cake, it's got phenomenal wi-fi reception and is really handy. New ""Skills"" - basically third-party plugins - add functionality to the Alexa products weekly. If you've owned an ultra-lame Fire device, don't be gun-shy, the Echo rocks. The only caveat is the speaker is just good. Not great. But good enough for room-filling sound. If you have you're own stereo system, consider the Dot.",POSITIVE
673,Got this product for a relative for christmas who had a kindle fire and was looking for an upgrade. With how far technology has grown on phones she was only looking for a reader and something that was lighter on her thumbs when reading then her kindle fire. This product was not only lighter on her thumbs but also worked great in any light.,POSITIVE
674,"It works great. Not affected by the singular WiFi band at all.Battery life is amazing.Just be sure you can get the apps you'd like from the appstore, google play isn't accessible. So if you're looking for Snapchat, Instagram, NBC, Comcast, Vudu, you won't get those here.Returning it. Which is too bad, I really enjoyed it. More bang for the buck if you could access those apps. But like I said, it was my fault for not checking first. I was expecting the 'apps from unknown sources' to kick in but it so didn't.",MIXED
675,Good product.........................................................,POSITIVE
676,It works well it takes time for it to know your vocabulary,POSITIVE
677,"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!",NEGATIVE

682,Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....,POSITIVE
683,This is a great tablet! It has lots of features. The cost is really low for such a great tablet.,POSITIVE
684,I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet.,POSITIVE
685,Everyone should have one. Awesome!! Just ask Alexa any question and she will give you the answer.,POSITIVE
686,This is really an awesome and useful gadget. Even our four-year-old has learned how to use it effectively. And each week I get an email describing new apps and benefits on it. I can't wait to see what comes out next week.,POSITIVE
687,"My son gave this to me for a B-day gift! Music, movies, shows - and some news. Since I ""cut the cable"" I find that there really is very little news that I can't get elsewhere. No more news-fix required! Works with my Fire Tablet too!",POSITIVE

693,I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!,POSITIVE

It's an underpriced item and I plan to buy 1 more.",POSITIVE

732,"Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son.

Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it.",POSITIVE

750,My kids had one before I had got free using reward points somewhere else and it broke so replacing it. Like how these have the colored backs.,NEGATIVE
751,"Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick.",POSITIVE
752,"It is all but perfection. It's a library in the hand. Inside or out. It reads equally as beautiful in either environment. I only penalize it for its lack of allowing books, bought outside Amazon ecosystem, to be included in FreeTime. FreeTime is advertised as for kids but I like the idea of knowing how much time I've spent reading and the other offerings of FreeTime.",POSITIVE
753,This tablet is great for using ebooks as a college student,POSITIVE

762,I purchased this item for my 10 year old son and he loves it. He is able to download books and any kind of games that he likes.,POSITIVE

764,This product is awesome point blank. It still needs improvement in the conversation AI in order to be able to have that extreme edge over the google home. But overall I love the home automation that is compatible with the product. Most importantly how well this behaves with vivint.,MIXED
765,"I have purchased a fire tab before for my wife. I would say it was the best consideration for a tablet. It lasted for a good time and I was really apprehensive from getting her one. It is durable in use, just don't go dropping it on cement. The only reason I gave a 4 star is because I haven't used it yet.",POSITIVE
766,Liked this because it had the functionality of an IPad without the high price tag.,POSITIVE

787,Great product. Highly recommended. Great value and great price,POSITIVE
788,Love this Kindle -It's a great size for travel as I can read it or check my emails or play games.,POSITIVE
789,"Just say Alexa and what you want her to do and she does it. Yes sometimes if there is some noise or if you don't speak clearly she might get it wrong but most of the time she gets it right. My only flaw with Alexa is the music, which isn't a problem with the product it's self but when it comes to playing music other than Pandora- you do have to subscribe to unlimited music which is reasonably priced and is worth it but do wish it came with it. Other than that I love asking Alexa to play a certain song and she plays it. She is amazing I would recommend it to anyone. Also look into her cool features their so helpful, definitely her to do list and grocery list.",MIXED
790,I like that it has an Automatic backlight adjustment,POSITIVE
791,Works fine and I am pleased with my purchase. I would purchase again.,POSITIVE
792,"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product.",MIXED
793,The battery life is pretty good and the best feature in my opinion is the expandable memory slot. It allows me to store all of music so I don't have to use my phone and get a call in the middle of a party,POSITIVE
794,Great tablet plan on purchasing another . Not slow happy with the speed,MIXED
795,I purchased the fire 7 almost one year ago. It is a very good tablet for the money. Screen resolution isn't the best but is adequate. But at this price point I am not complaining. WiFi seems to have slowed a bit since when it was new and I dont have many apps and I do clear the background tasks. That being said it is faster than my previous fire HD 2012 generation. Cameras are so so but I don't use them often if at all. Having the micro SD slot is great. Amazon does a great job of automatically up dating the OS. I just received the Alexa update yesterday. Pick this tablet up on Black Friday oor an even better deal!,MIXED
796,I bought these for my young grandchildren (5 & 7) and they love them. They love to take pictures and make videos. They also play games on them. The battery life lasts for a long time also.,POSITIVE
797,We purchased this for our 10 yr old son with Aspergers. He was immediately able to understand and navigate the Amazon Fire. Thank you.,POSITIVE
798,"I have the Amazon Echo in my kitchen where we run around and usually holding food in our hands while prepping or rushing out. It's nice to be able to just call out a certain song or music station to quickly start hearing some music while busy. Also, if we are in a rush to leave and want to know the temperature to make sure to have proper attire. This device just makes life a little simpler and faster.",POSITIVE
799,There shouldnt be an 8 gig tablet. Not enough internal memory. Kindle Fire tablets work on a modified Android operating system. But other than that a good tablet for the price.,MIXED
800,Nothing comes close. So much faster then anything else out there.,POSITIVE
801,I like the slick size and the whole voice remote. Now with Alexa you can even control your smart home devices. I upgraded from Fire Stick and the interface needs getting used to.... I like the stick lay out .,POSITIVE

804,I purchased this kindle for my daughter inlaw for Christmas. She absolutely loves it!,POSITIVE
805,My girls love the tablet. It has lots of apps they can download. The only problem the battery is used up even when not in use.,MIXED
806,"I had ordered the Echo and from what I had read I did not think I would need the Remote. The Echo works great if you are in the same Room. I like to listen to Music while I am cooking, cleaning, or doing nothing. I always had to go back in the same room to where my Echo was to change or skip to the next Song if I wanted. With the Remote I can change it from any room. I just stick it in my Pocket and take it out when I want to switch, turn it down or up. Connects through Blue Tooth very quickly. Has a magnetic holder to keep the Remote on (mine is on my Desk Leg) to keep it when not in use. There is a Felt Pad on the back of the Magnetic Holder so that it will not scratch any surface that it is attached to. I love it!",POSITIVE
807,This thing is ok as long as you don't expect it to be or have stuff(Apps&Games) like Samsung or Apple cause it doesn't. It has its own line of ****,MIXED
808,It's a awesome price for first time tablets for kids,POSITIVE

811,Right out of the box it didn't work. We took it back and the Geek Squad couldn't get it to work either. Great disappointment for my 9 year old boy since it was a Christmas gift.,NEGATIVE
812,It's fun to have at a party when everyboby can ask it questions or ask for there favoite music.,POSITIVE
813,"I buy these often for trade show booth prizes. The customers are always excited about them, and they make great gifts!",POSITIVE
814,"Tablet was purchased for a 10 yr old - it's great for him to play games on, listen to music and watch movies/YouTube. Very easy for him to figure out.",POSITIVE

818,Love Alexa! She is very informative and works my lights and plays my favorite music!! I highly recommend this to everyone!,POSITIVE
819,I initially read e-books on my old Kindle that needed a light. I then migrated to using my mini iPad with a kindle app. The brightness bothered my eyes and outside it was pretty useless. I bought the paper white as it has a backlight that isn't too strong. Love it!,POSITIVE
820,"This is actually worth the money to purchase if you're wanting to watch Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. Everything that you can download on your android devices will be on here and you can even download games to play for kids and adults alike. Easy to set up and use. Just need to set up your Amazon account, and if you don't have one you can make one to use it. Bought one for my mother in law. Best $100 spent. I do not regret this purchase at all.",POSITIVE

825,Love my echo without it Ill die it helps me with my appointments .,POSITIVE
826,We bought three of these while on sale. They replace my ereader and my children's ipod touches and we use them every day. I cannot stress how good of a deal this is! While the display isn't the best - you're getting far mor than what you pay for.,MIXED
827,"Great tablet for my kids to use. Plenty of apps to choose, easy to set up and add parental controls. Cheap enough as well for what my kids use it for games and videos instead of spending 4 times as much on a different tablet",POSITIVE

The 2 year old loves watching Elmo on the tablet and it's not too loud and the picture is very clear and colorful and she knows how to push the icons on the screen herself, the 5 and 7 year old plays car racing games as well as reading and math games. It has parental settings on the tablet so that I can assure that's it content is kid friendly. They love it.",POSITIVE
835,works fine,POSITIVE
836,"Echo simply did not do anything it was advertised to do. Basic weather was sporadic and more detailed questions resulted in ""Cannot find response"".",NEGATIVE

838,This it's a great tablet for kids it does a good kid and keep them busy,POSITIVE

841,This is one of the best tablets in this price range.,POSITIVE

844,Great product but needs to learn more. It would be nice if it could connect to tv sound.,MIXED

We're so happy with it we just bought the new Echo Dot. The speaker in the Echo is great. We purchased the Echo Dot for areas of our home that already had a good music system, but we wanted the other great features Echo has outside of playing music.",POSITIVE
846,Works great. Is a good upgrade for those who have a regular kindle. Terrific for low light reading.,POSITIVE
847,"I was hesitant to add more gizmos in my life, but after a trial run got hooked on it. Response at times is not forthcoming but I guess with time it will get better. So far so good. Does what is intended.",POSITIVE
848,Had to buy Sims cards for more storage but good choice for kids,MIXED
849,This tablet is a great starter for a low cost!!!!!,POSITIVE
850,"I bought the echo in white. I think it looks better than the black one. Also bought a dot for the bedroom. If you get this and an Insteon starter kit, you can use Alexa to control your plug in lamps. It works well and I recommend buying it.",POSITIVE

863,Needed an inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.,POSITIVE
864,"I bought three of these tablets for my three boys (ages 9 - 13). The tablets were easy to setup and the boys love them. They seem to be very durable.I like the fact that I can connect them to my Amazon account and they have a lot of detailed parental controls available. I can, for example, limit time on games and movies separately from books so they spend their screen time actually getting some reading done. I can also limit total daily screen time so there is no struggle when it's time for them to get off the tablets.I'm very pleased with the purchase and highly recommend the Amazon Fire tablet.",POSITIVE

Was a better gift for my lil sis who now gets a break while the tablets babysit ;)I like the sleek design, the quality feel of the materials, the sharp graphics, beautiful colors and fast response of the tablet. Also, for the price, not many others are comparable. Setup wasn't as easy as some I've had in the past, but we got it done.

Both 7"" tablets exceeded my expectations and then some. I downloaded all my apps for my Amazon account and Google Play Store. Setting Kodi was as easy as Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, just download the apps. I love this tablet, it works very well. I bought it because I love to check my e-mails etc. Having a 7"" screen makes it all easy and simple. As far as apps go, it has Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and tumblr available. It does not have Instagram available at the Amazon Store, but it does have it at Google Play Store. This Amazon Fire 7"" tablet is so lightweight, and you will love it too.

920,"This 7 inch tablet exceeded my expectations and then some. I was apprehensive about having advertising on the wake-up screen, but with a simple swipe of the thumb it goes away with no waiting. It streams Netflix and UV copies from Flixster with zero lag and no buffering. Expandable memory, (Micro SD). This is basically an android tablet, so if you have experience using that platform, you will have no trouble navigating the settings menu, etc. There is no Google Play store access, however, the Amazon App store is available and is pretty impressive. The resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. One of my complaints with my old tablet was the visibilty when viewing at an angle, but this tablet does not have the same issue. All in all, this $50 tablet is the best value I have seen, as it outperforms the dual core $250 tablet I just replaced. If you are looking for a 7 inch tablet, you can NOT go wrong with this one.",POSITIVE

936,We bought this to stream TV so we could cut our cable bill. Streaming live TV with Playstaion Vue and watching movies through Amazon Prime has worked well. We also have the less expensive Fire Stick and this product works much better.,POSITIVE

944,Great mini portable smart stereo for a beginner! Sitting in my hot tub listening to free Pandora. Alexa controls my Hue Go lighting. Also portable. Cant wait to get the Hue Bloom for the back porch too. These are my relaxation toys to wind down with on the back porch at the end of a long day. I also use Alexa in the house. She controls lighting in the bedrooms and kitchen and Im increasingly learning more about her. She gives me my daily flash briefing of the news. She answers questions like who sang that song and so on. Lots of FUN!,POSITIVE
945,I just loved it .. it was really nice .. I would definitely recommend to buy the product,POSITIVE
946,"I got this for $35 during Black Friday. Since I've had it, I noticed that the battery life does not last very long. I have to charge it at least once a day. At first, I thought that I may have a faulty tablet, but I looked on Amazon's website and the Fire has a battery life of 7 hours...no wonder.The size of the Fire, though is small enough that I can take it with me when I go out and am waiting to pass the time. I also bring this with me to the gym and watch movies or read on it while I'm on the treadmill or stationary bike.I use the Fire for different things. Mainly, to play apps and stream videos on Amazon prime. For these functions, there's a little in the animation, when I play games, but it isn't frequent.I have read several books on the Fire and I must say, that I prefer to read off of the Nook HD. The print on the Fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not as crisp as the Nook.Since the Fire is from Amazon, it is locked down to only work with ""Amazon approved"" apps. As I mentioned earlier, I have a Nook as well. On that, I am able to download the Kindle app and read books that I have purchased through Amazon on the Nook. On the Fire, however, I am not able to download the Nook app so that I can read books that I have purchased through for the Nook.Overall, for the price that I paid, this is not bad. This is one of those tablets that if it gets dropped, I wouldn't get a headache over it.",POSITIVE
947,This device is wonderful and very handy. I really like this very much.,POSITIVE
948,Bought this for my wife as second amazon tablet that ask for and got what she wanted. Now she's enjoying it!,POSITIVE
949,Far and away blows away the Echo Dot in terms of sound quality. The higher cost is offset by the need to purchase a decent quality bluetooth speaker for the Dot.,POSITIVE

961,"This tablet is excellent when you are an on-the-go person. You not only have the ability to access the internet, but you have the ability to read a good book as well. You will not have to lug a big book with you if youre out and about. I have never had a tablet where books can be downloaded onto it (and its free). I am one satisfied customer!",POSITIVE
962,"Love love love! No squinting, no glare just beautiful words! Bought one as a gift for an avid reader friend too.",POSITIVE
963,Overall its not bad. I like all that it offers I just wish it wasn't so finicky. You ask it a question and will say hmm i don't have the answer to that. And then ask it the same question again just slightly different it's is able to answer. None the less its a good buy.,MIXED

Access to Kindle store for book downloads and plenty of storage for many books are just some of the great features .,POSITIVE
993,Daughter loves it and great customer service! Educational and fun!,POSITIVE
994,Really impressed with what this tablet is capable of doing for price. At only 49 dollars it is pretty snappy accessing the internet and playing videos are sharp and clear. Most of the apps I need to use are available and free. It seems to run similar to Android tablets which should be easy for someone familiar with how android operates. This might be for kids to use but it fits with what I need to use.,POSITIVE

1003,"Otherwise, I have really enjoyed my Kindle Fire and use it all the time. Love being able to read anywhere. Also watch movies on it with good resolution.",POSITIVE
1004,"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for.",MIXED
1005,"This Amazon fire tablet is a nice little tablet. Picture is sufficient for the price. Audio output is on back so if it's in a case, the sound is muted, but otherwise nice tablet for the price....",MIXED

1011,"the Kindle Voyage is the very best ereader that I've ever used. The light is great and does bother my eyes in the the dark at all (iPads, Fire and Nook tablets bother me in dim light and extended reading) while providing light read by. The controls are simple and easy to learn. However it is slightly pricey. For me the quality and relief are well worth the price.",POSITIVE

Battery backup lasts for days....perfect for book lovers.. give it a try.. all the best..",POSITIVE
1025,I have had an Amazon Echo since it came out and i Love it. I recently purchased a Google home and found at this moment it is not as good as the Amazon echo I'm sure the Google home Will get better over time but right now Alexa is the best. The sound that comes out of the Amazon Echo is better then the Google home plus you can connect Bluetooth to the echo but not the Google home. This black Friday (2016) I purchased another Echo and a few Echo Dots (Dots are a great price) and i could't be more happy.,POSITIVE
1026,"Ive always used apple devices, but this little gadget is full of surprises",POSITIVE
1027,Its an excellent tacky for the prices. It works well and the picture quality is excellent.,POSITIVE

1030,bought this for my wife she loves the fact she can now expand the memory to 128 gig,POSITIVE
1031,"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(",NEGATIVE
1032,"If you've had a kindle you know it's more like reading a book page. Some will prefer it enough to have this device. My elderly mother uses the version of this that connects to cell towers and is able to download her own books from her subscription service. She had trouble removing them once she hits the download limit. I have this version. If you have wifi, I think this is the best option if you have the money. I don't see much purpose in the upgrade and I don't know who wants a bigger bezel. The touch works fine. My only complaint is there is no speaker and at this price it should. I had to buy an adapter to have books read to me. The text to speech is very good and realistic.",POSITIVE
1033,"I own a business in finance and need to read a lot on varied subjects. the kindle enables me to find referenced books and download them in a few seconds. I haven't tried but apparently you can even upload your own pdfs. The fonts and screen resolution and lighting are extremely pleasant, and it is easier to hold than a book. I removed 1 star because the highlighting and note taking systems can get laggy, images are sometimes hard to zoom on, and you can't copy paste a quote. But overall because of the access and convenience it offers I highly recommend it.",POSITIVE
1034,"I like my ECHO, she however will talk on her own sometime. Still getying used to it. We mainly use it fir the bluetooth so we can play mudic from Pandora and Youtube.",MIXED
1035,"This is my third Echo. The secret is the array of microphones. It hears you over music and in your natural speaking voice. Very helpful and a good speaker. Easiest way ever to connect your phone to a Bluetooth speaker. ""Alexa, Bluetooth connect,"" and you are done.",POSITIVE
1036,"This Paperwhite (back-lit) Kindle is wonderful. No more Itty-bitty book light needed! Just turn on and read, even at night. And there is no glow during the daylight. In addition, I took it to the beach and read it there..no glare unlike the iPad. I had one of the early Kindles, so maneurving around the menu is different but easy to learn and get use to.",POSITIVE
1037,"Great product, love all the things you can do with the Echo - music, games, weather, sports, conversions, etc",POSITIVE
1038,"I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption.",POSITIVE
1039,"I purchased this for my dad.He is 84 years and enjoys having her play music for him, tell him the weather and even helps control lighting. He loves her jokes and her witty come backs. She is his virtual pet.",POSITIVE

1045,"Wanted to buy a reliable and cost effective tablet. Was afraid the screen might be too small. Dad loved it. He is 70 and not too tech savvy but is able to browse the Internet, use Skype and listen to music. He is afraid he will purchase something by mistake and get a charge on his credit card. :)",MIXED
1046,"I got this for my mum and she wanted it to watch movies in bed or download a book. It works well for this, but a manual would have been a boon as she is older and not tech savvy. It's not always easy or convenient for an older person to use new tech without a struggle. This wasn't too bad in the end, and she is enjoying it.",MIXED
1047,I bought this for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. It has many games and other games can be downloaded. She is also able to watch videos and mom can set parental controls to limit time and usage.,POSITIVE
1048,Best investment I've made! Doesn't really buffer like the other sticks .,POSITIVE

1087,"It is tough to use these tablets if you are use to Apple products. Internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the Amazon programs it is running.

The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly.",POSITIVE
1103,Excellent gift for my grandkids. They love it and play with it all the time.,POSITIVE
1104,I love Amazon now there's so much functionality especially with video. This works great and the quality is amazing,POSITIVE
1105,Definitely enjoy using this at home. I was surprised at how intuitive it is and was able to answer any question in seconds. I mostly use it to play music through Amazon player. I know there's tons more it can do and can't wait to take advantage of all its capabilities.,POSITIVE

1108,"Light weight, long battery life. Love the back lighting",POSITIVE
1109,Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.,POSITIVE
1110,Was not hard to set up and love the quality. Good screen size and clarity.,POSITIVE
1111,"We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile.",POSITIVE
1112,I love this unit. I'm learning new things I can do with it every day. Lately I've been using it to listen to audible purchases.,POSITIVE
1113,"I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do – including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source.",POSITIVE
1114,I use it to keep her busy with educational games and she loves being on it!,POSITIVE
1115,Dose every thing and more. This is the best streaming device out!!!,POSITIVE

1117,This is the third time I have purchased this item for the tv's in my house. I completely love it,POSITIVE
1118,The echo has been on the market for a while. As a long time amazon customer I received one of the initial offers to purchase the echo before it was available to the general public for a low price of $100. Not knowing what it was I passed and regretted it ever since. So when I saw that Best buy was offering it for 89 I purchased it. They are adding functionality all the time good product.,POSITIVE
1119,It's show everything in great view of videos and..,POSITIVE
1120,Very slow ...I guess it's worth the 40 bucks.. great product for a child..,MIXED

1129,Amazing device! Makes life easier I use it all the time,POSITIVE
1130,"What a device! Ask Alexie what time it is, how far it is from Pluto to Saturn or play some Buddy Holley, she does it all. Loads o f fun!",POSITIVE
1131,"Bought the Fire TV because the remote could be used to control Slingbox, plus being an Amazon Prime member had access to a lot of content. Works great",POSITIVE
1132,"I love reading on the kindle Paperwhite in any light. Dark, Sun. It doesn't matter. Plus you can borrow Kindle Books from the library for FREE!",POSITIVE
1133,Wish Alexa was smarter but this is a good touch to anyone's home entertainment system.,MIXED
1134,"For the money, you really can't do much better in the tablet department. Quick, responsive and does everything you want it to do. Highly recommended",POSITIVE
1135,Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.,POSITIVE
1136,This is the perfect tablet for my 3 year old son. He loves it and it is easy for him to navigate. It is also easy for me to set up parental controls and give him access to certain apps.,POSITIVE
1137,"It's perfect for me, my husband and my daughterthere are so many apps we downloaded, Sling, Nick Jr, Disney, CNN etc.If you're looking for the end all answer to cut your cable TV service, FireTv does not have things like live CNN, AMC and other cable stations (yet), but you could purchase a subscription for Sling TV (Google it) which has ala-carte live TV services. Something Apple is promising to deliver. If you have a current cable subscription, you can get things like HBO and Netflix streamed to your box if you are already paying for it in your home cable subscription. Your provider ""passes through"" the HBO, Netflix, etc",POSITIVE
1138,The Echo is awesome! I purchased this with the intention of controlling my Hue Lights through voice however it has much more features than expected. My wife now turns it on daily for iHeart Radio. I purchased this almost 1 month ago and I'm still discovering new things with it. The only issue is there is no Plex app however I'm sure one is in the works soon.,POSITIVE
1139,This tablet can be summed up in four words.Phenomenal performance/minimal cost,POSITIVE
1140,My requirement for this tablet was reading kindle ebooks and watching Netflix. I don't play games and no need of browsing on the table too. Bought it tablet on BF for $35 and found it to be a good value for reading. The only problem I faced is a couple of updates I received lately which have slowed down the performance a bit (that's why 4 stars). Watching Netflix is also good on this tablet.Overall worth the $35 I paid for it.,MIXED
1141,a lot of the times Alexa will come back and say I don't understand the question get very annoying,NEGATIVE
1142,Mucch better than my previous tablet. Runs great and fast. Best decision ever,POSITIVE
1143,Great box better than the firestick and other boxes,POSITIVE
1144,I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.,POSITIVE
1145,"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead",MIXED
1146,"Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it.",POSITIVE
1147,"I now have 3 of these tablets. I use them for my harmony remotes, baby camera monitors, youtube for the kids, receiver software, reading articles and books, games and many other things. Its not the best tablet out there, but for under $50 its great. My one issue is that it does NOT have the play store, so if amazon does not have an app you will have to side load it. Other than that you can't beat it.",MIXED
1148,We love our Amazon Fire TV! We get all our favorite shows and movies. It works perfectly!,POSITIVE
1149,I bought two kindles for my children and they love them. They are easy to navigate for all of them .,POSITIVE

1152,Great for kids just learning to use a tablet for the first time.,POSITIVE
1153,"I bought this for my son to occupy him on car trips. If you are an Amazon Prime member, then this really makes sense to own",POSITIVE
1154,Christmas gift for my nieces & they absolutly loved them.....,POSITIVE
1155,Great buy for the price. We currently own 4 of them. Buying my grandson one for Christmas too.,POSITIVE
1156,"Great for beginners, I had one and then I got my stepson one.",POSITIVE
1157,Easy and age appropriate. Can set timers for tv and movie watching my granddaughter finds the educational games more interesting and fun.,POSITIVE
1158,Just what I needed. Works great inside or outside. Must have a cover to protect the screen.,POSITIVE
1159,"Really fun and nifty device...we use it for setting alarms, checking movies, weather info, playing music and getting answers. We are evolving with it to discover new ways to utilize the Echo. Speaker quality is very good...better than I expected.",POSITIVE
1160,"Easy to operate, glare free adjustable brightness is great for nighttime or daytime reading.",POSITIVE
1161,Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.,POSITIVE
1162,"I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!",POSITIVE
1163,I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it,POSITIVE
1164,Just ok even for the low price of 33$. It's more like a toy than a tablet.,NEGATIVE
1165,"This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!",POSITIVE
1166,"Bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday, I love how easily she can just click and download whatever she wants without bugging me for passwords. The 2 year worry free guarantee is also very nice to have since kids will be kids!",POSITIVE
1167,Good for the kids and it works for playing games and reading. Exactly what I needed it for. Very happy.,POSITIVE
1168,Great product for beginners and senior citizens. Simple to operate.,POSITIVE
1169,Bought it for my nephew and he loved it. Great purchase,POSITIVE
1170,"I spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen; when it comes time for leisure reading, it is nice to have relief from bright light. The paperwhite Kindle provides a very eye-friendly experience, with sharp text even at a small size. And there's no struggle with holding open pages of a book. Unlike the Kindle Fire, obviously, it is not a good choice for browsing the web or reading e-mail. Navigation between books is not as easy as I would like; a half screen of 6 recent books, with the other half taken up by ""recommended"" books is not as handy as a full-screen text list of my books would be. But the actual process of reading is easy, and there are a few tools for note taking and seeing how frequently other people highlight sections of text. Cross-book text searching is a great feature, if you need it, too.",MIXED
1171,This ia a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for entertainment.,POSITIVE
1172,I purchased this in order to stream Playstation Vue. It works very well for this. Amazon also offers 4K content - one of the few places you can get it for now.,POSITIVE
1173,"The Fire TV is an impressive device. There are tons of apps available and enough content for everyone. I recently cut the cord with Comcast and mostly view Prime content, which loads and plays quickly. The remote is super easy to use too. Great product and great value.",POSITIVE
1174,Great product works well especially enjoy the voice commands and the Ethernet cord works well. Love the apps and its very user friendly,POSITIVE
1175,"This Amazon Fire tablet is AMAZING. It's not an ipad or galaxy, but it still packs a ton of value into a nice package. You get a lot of nice features here, and not a lot of bull, as one would often expect from a device so cheap. The screen is surprisingly well made and durable. While it's not the sharpest one out there, it's not exactly blurry either at 1024 x 600 pixels. There is only a single speaker, and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen. The speaker gets to a decent volume, but I would not consider it to be loud. I took a leap of faith here in buying this and I am so very glad that I did because this tablet has far surpassed my expectations in every way. The games are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what I've seen so far. This plays demanding 3d games pretty well I may add. The Amazon store has a lot of cool free things to mess with when you first start out. It only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything. The micro sd slot accepts up to 128gb cards. Battery life is ok. If not gaming on this, you can expect 6 hours or more. With light use, this could last all day on a single charge. Video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright. The responsiveness of the screen is spot on. I can't really mention any downfall , because there really isn't any. The one thing I will say could be better it the wifi. When set to default settings, wifi kept turning off on me. Once I set wifi up to be always on, it was much better. You usually get what you pay for. In this case, you get more. This unit feels like it could have easily cost well over $100. I'm just sad that I didn't yet get a protective case for mine. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone who needs a nice tablet or wants a nice gift for someone. This Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet earns a solid 10 out of 10 stars from me. I'm picky too. If you are even slightly considering this, just buy it. You won't be disappointed.",POSITIVE
1176,My wife and I couldn't be happier with our Amazon Echo! With our home wifi it was so easy to setup ! Alexa what did we ever do without you ! Look if your looking at reviews then you've done some research and know what the Echo is all about and all it can do ! Don't hesitate buy it now !,POSITIVE
1177,"I bought this because we wanted to ""Cut the Cord"" and not having any real knowledge of how these things worked, i bought this and played with it for a while and now i could not live without it. The only limitations i have found are the companies (Networks) that do not have apps. I would recommend this to anyone looking to ""Cut the Cord"".",MIXED
1178,"We had a Netgear streaming device for years which was adequate until the remote quit functioning. After checking it out online and visiting the store I felt comfortable purchasing this device. It was easy to setup and get online. It is amazing how much faster, better and smoother our streaming has been. The built in apps are good and there were many more (free) apps that I found and installed without a problem. Some that I installed required that I have a cable TV subscription and so I had to ""log in"" to get them functional but not a big deal. The unit itself is not cheap in appearance nor in quality. It has a nice weight to it and feels substantially durable. The remote is great and the Android App is even better. My local Best Buy store had enough in stock and no hassles. We love our Amazon Fire TV!",POSITIVE
1179,Enjoy all the features of the tablets from gaming to pictures. Battery life is good as well,POSITIVE
1180,Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading.,POSITIVE
1181,"I've been playing with this for a few weeks. It is not perfect, but it is great for listening to music and audiobooks. I don't like watching the news, so the ""Flash Briefing"" is very nice. Sometimes it does not get the full headline, but I get the gist of it, and I don't have to go through the depressing details. I'm looking forward to learning how to create my own skills for it. The speaker isn't the best I've ever heard, but it's definitely not the worst. The IFTTT integration is great, and I have setup triggers to many devices in my house and the Shopping List is great.",POSITIVE
1182,I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!,POSITIVE
1183,great streaming box for watching great movies. amazon tv is fast and fluid to use. they have alot of movies.,POSITIVE
1184,Great product for children to enjoy for a low price.,POSITIVE
1185,"Overall it's okay, I don't like that it takes forever to charge.",MIXED
1186,This thing is ok. Next time we get electronics it will be Amason,NEUTRAL
1187,I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!,POSITIVE
1188,I love this thing. Works great with wifi enabled smart home products.,POSITIVE
1189,Bought this for someone special. Has not been operated much yet.,NEGATIVE
1190,Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.,MIXED
1191,"I replaced this with a fire stick hoping it would be faster, and it definitely is. It keeps apps opened to where you last left them, no more loading the app every time you turn on your tv. Well worth the extra $55.",POSITIVE
1192,Great tablet all around. Good for kids for the parental control options.,POSITIVE
1193,I purchased for a 7 year old perfect buy. She loved it,POSITIVE
1194,"We bought this Amazon Fire TV to use for our Sony PlayStation Vue package as part of our cord-cutting plan. We are also Amazon Prime members so it made sense for that application also. The picture is great on our Samsung 65"" 4K tv. The only drawback so far (why I only gave it 4 stars) is that our Logitech Harmony 650 remote will not operate it, thereby forcing us to keep track of the remote.",MIXED
1195,Very pleased with Fire TV. It works as described. Excellent item,POSITIVE
1196,So far I like the backlit feature. I felt the price was affordable. The battery life is not as long as my previous Kindle but it does a lot more so that is to be expected.,POSITIVE
1197,My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic.,POSITIVE
1198,Bought to use with PlayStation view as my tv provider. It works great so far.,POSITIVE
1199,What more can be said about the Echo? It is a quality device that works exactly as advertised.,POSITIVE
1200,"Didn't know how many lingering questions I had until I got an Amazon Echo. I mean, every little thing I want to know, I now just ask and hope Alexa knows. Very helpful to just get a quick answer to most things.",POSITIVE
1201,It's great to be hands free..just ask alexa to add to shopping list or play specific music..nice sound .. no typing required ... Love it,POSITIVE
1202,"The sound is better at mid to low volumes, but at max the voices are great... I also have the Echo tap and the echo dot... They all work Great,,, This one for sure has a bigger sound...",POSITIVE
1203,"One my favorite color ..................:.::::.::,",POSITIVE
1204,"This kindle is really good for the price. Screen is too small for me,but for my daughter it is perfect. Does a lot of cool things.",POSITIVE
1205,The screen is well lit and easy to read. The compact size is also quite nice.,POSITIVE
1206,The Echo with Alexa enabled is an excellent personal entertainment system. She is quite intuitive and always learning. Highly recommended.,POSITIVE
1207,"You aren't going to find a better tablet for this price. Loading non-amazon apps can be a pain and the OS is not the best, but it's great for games and reading.",MIXED
1208,"I got this because I could not read my books on my iPad at the beach. This allows me to read in the sun. Best product ever, great price",POSITIVE
1209,"Nice reader, good screen, easy to use, and the camera is a nice bonus.",POSITIVE
1210,Functional for anything you want to do. Not extremely fast but works pretty great,MIXED
1211,"Quality and packaging is nice.It's a Kindle USB charger, it works what more can I say.I also charge my Bluetooth earphones with this.",POSITIVE
1212,"I guess I thought you could ask it anything kinda like Google. You have to program everything it does,pretty limited right now. But still pretty cool",MIXED
1213,"Had the kindle 7th gen with no backlight and upgraded to the paperwhite. Was one of the best decisions I've made. You don't even notice that there IS a backlight because it blends in so well, and compared to the 7th gen is a night-and-day difference. Buy this, you will not regret it.",POSITIVE
1214,Great for searching and opening multiple apps at once.,POSITIVE
1215,Affordable tablet for kids to use. Great deal!!!!!!,POSITIVE
1216,"My cousin are really happy..nice working, good looking",POSITIVE
1217,Excellent ratio quality price. Lightweight. Good resolution and easy to use.,POSITIVE
1218,Wanted to cut the cable cord and heard from friends about fire tv. Gave it a go and so glad I did. We love the programming and we pay for the shows we want instead of overpaying for cable. Would highly recommend fire tv,POSITIVE
1219,This is the BEST tablet for the money anywhere on the planet!!,POSITIVE
1220,The sound is really good for a portable speaker. I have 2 dots but use this one in the living room to listen to music.,POSITIVE
1221,"Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv.",POSITIVE
1222,This FireTV is amazing in the way it can turn any tv into a smart tv. It is quick and responsive. We only using it for its streaming capabilities but so much more can be done with it. We also own a Firestick and they both seem the same for performance. So if you only plan on using its streaming capabilities you might want to look into the cheaper firestick.,POSITIVE
1223,I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles.,POSITIVE
1224,This tablet is a great value for the price point. Great functionality and value.,POSITIVE
1225,"Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email.",POSITIVE
1226,Love the Fire - play games on it every day. It is small enough to carry with you but powerful enough to watch movies.,POSITIVE
1227,Love love love this thing. I listen to all my jams in the morning while checking in the the forecast so I always if a sweater is needed. Lol,POSITIVE
1228,This is my third. I buy them for all my grandkids.,POSITIVE
1229,"Nice tablet. Love reading books on this, kid profile option is excellent",POSITIVE
1230,We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!,POSITIVE
1231,"My family and I constantly use Alexa to listen to music, help with cooking, check the weather, help with homework and listen to the news. One of my favorite purchases ever.",POSITIVE
1232,"The Echo is fun, functional and entertaining. The commands are appropriately responded to approximately 80% of the time. The ability to simply orally request songs by a specific artist or a specific song is amazing. The music catalogue is extremely large and wide ranging. News, weather and straight forward informational requests are almost always answered correctly and clearly. The technological applications are varied and growing. They don't interest me--yet. The music alone makes this device a marvel and a bargain.",POSITIVE
1233,This device works as well as all the reviews have claimed. It was so simple to set up and works very well.,POSITIVE
1234,Gets the job done,POSITIVE
1235,Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.,POSITIVE
1236,Don't hesitate to buy. Very user friendly platform.,POSITIVE
1237,This is a great item to have. Integrates well with different home security items.,POSITIVE
1238,"Bought for my Grandson for Christmas. He loves it. Glad I went with the 16GB,Thanks to the advice of BEST Buy employee.",POSITIVE

1240,Just looking for an affordable tablet and found this one...very pleased!,POSITIVE
1241,Had no problem with the instructions available in the system itself. Enjoy the 'easy on the eyes' lighting.,POSITIVE
1242,My 11 year loves the Amazon Fire. It is user friendly.,POSITIVE
1243,"We have had a Fire Stick for quite some time that we use for our Playstation Vue subscription. I decided to purchase the Fire TV as a second Playstation Vue device because it has the wired ethernet option, and WiFi isn't a reliably fast enough connection for the streaming services. The Fire TV performs wonderfully, and is much snappier in performance than the Stick even in the menus. Our Apple TV has now been unused for several months.",POSITIVE
1244,Alexa keeps you updated on news and weather. Great to answer questions. Fun to use.,POSITIVE
1245,"I love my new kindle. I bought one earlier this summer for myself and just recently for my ten year old. One function that is awesome is its ability to work with the audible application. I can read on my kindle then audible will pick up where I left off, so I can continue with the read during my commute. My kindle will then propose to move my place to where I left off in audible. It has made my commute very purposeful because I am able to read literature for work a lot more efficiently. This may have been one of the smartest purchases I have ever made for professional development!",POSITIVE
1246,"Ive only had one tablet before this one so its great that this tablet didnt ""lose me"" in technology and also do everything I bought it for at the same time.",POSITIVE
1247,Apps and streaming run great. Searching and growing movie and show selection could use some tweets.,POSITIVE

1249,"Simple to use, a must own if you have Amazon Prime",POSITIVE
1250,Alexa works great. It was easy to set-up and to us. My wife uses it for playing music through her iPhone and is very happy with it. I am always finding and learning new things with Alexa.,POSITIVE
1251,Bought it for my niece and nephews as a beginner tablet and turned out pretty well. Value buy.,POSITIVE
1252,This is a great item!!! You can ask her basically anything and she will let you know the answer. Even How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.,POSITIVE
1253,"The one I have been using, generic, is so bad. You have to mess with it to get it to work. I really love this one . Small and plugs in nice and tight.",MIXED
1254,A little difficult for inexperienced to setup but good price.,MIXED
1255,I will start off with the fact that I like paper books a lot. I bought the e reader because it's light and can travel with multiple books. The interface is fairly easy to use and it holds a lot of books. The automatic light feature doesn't work as nicely as I would. Overall I am happy with the purchase but there are features that could make it a 5.,MIXED
1256,"After about two weeks I ended up returning this item. It constantly froze and when it was working it was no faster than my fire stick.The voice search was a joke. I'm pretty tied in to the Amazon ecosystem, I love my Echo, but I was disappointed with this device. And for a hundred dollars? No thanks.",NEGATIVE
1257,I like my Kindle. This device could be a later technology. For the price Amazon could include more features.,POSITIVE
1258,The Amazon Echo worked so well I purchased 3 Dots. Very good speech recognition and text to voice. The more I learn the more I like it.,POSITIVE
1259,"We have several Alexa units throughout our home and love the way it will control lights, TV, and Thermostats.",POSITIVE

1262,"Finnally decided to read book on eink instead of ipad and got this kindle.I just love it, it is amazing. The text is crispy just like real ink, and the backlight is helful in all lighting conditions. Kindle books are cheaper, so buying this reader actually saves you a lot of money.",POSITIVE
1263,I Bought This For My Five Year Sister. It's Easy To Use & She Loves It. She Had A Nabi Before But The Charger Port Wasn't Suited For A Young Child It Was Easy To Break. This Tablet Is Ten Times Better All Around.,POSITIVE
1264,Great way to listen to music and great questions answered.,POSITIVE
1265,"Control it all with your voice, need I say more? Very user friendly and easy to set up. Once you start using Echo, you will wonder why you didn't before.",POSITIVE
1266,"Great product no complaints, spend a little extra on good internet and never worry about cable.",POSITIVE

1271,Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.,POSITIVE
1272,"Have tried using an iPad and other devices for reading, I was worried this would not work for my needs. Light as a book, even lighter, I don't mind laying in bed or reclining on the couch to read anymore. Good for reading heavier books that would cause arm strain to hold while reading. Bright at night enough to read with the lights off but not bright enough to bother my wife who is sleeping",POSITIVE
1273,"I used to have a old version of kindle, and this one is a great improvement, the resolution is great and the backlight is especially convenient",POSITIVE
1274,"I bought 2, hardest part was going from iOS to learning to use the kindle fire. My daughter and brother love it!",POSITIVE
1275,"This was easy to set up. Easier to have your Hue lights already in place and then run ""discovery"". I watched You tube videos before setting up and it was not hard at all. Need to download the free app Amazon Echo. It connected with Philips hue lights. To connect with my nest thermostat I needed the IFTTT app. (Echo sends your command via the IFTTT app to nest. Thinking about getting another for other room.",POSITIVE
1276,Fire tablets most most awesome with lots of good images,POSITIVE
1277,much faster and stable than the fire tv stick... definitely worth the upgrade,POSITIVE

1279,Finally an affordable name brand tablet with all the bells and whistles. Amazon has outdone it's self with this little gem.,POSITIVE
1280,"For the price, this tablet is great! Does what is needed and its sleek.",POSITIVE
1281,I would recommend this item who likes watching current TV and Movies and also the archived shows & movies,POSITIVE
1282,"I bought this on Black Friday because of the $35 price. I wanted one since I enjoyed using my wife's. This one is a little smaller than hers, but it works wonderful. I have a lot of books downloaded & about 5 games. It has 8gb of memory so it can't handle a ton of games. It can handle those no problem. I really enjoy reading on this before bed and when I need to pass time.",POSITIVE
1283,I love that this tablet came preloaded. All we needed to do was charge it and my child had access to many books at an appropriate level.,POSITIVE
1284,"I was excited to purchase the Amazon Echo, but when I thought that I could carry it out on the beach I was a little disappointed. If it had the capabilities to have a battery life to use without being plugged up it would be excellent.",MIXED
1285,Awesome device for my six year old. Very safe useage,POSITIVE
1286,It was easy to set up and very quick on the upload.,POSITIVE
1287,I purchased the FireTV to integrate into my Control4 system as a media streaming device. It has worked flawlessly in the mode. I'm still getting used to the controls but they seem pretty straight forward.,POSITIVE
1288,Amazon fire tv has everything you will ever need in terms of streaming. I only carry local cable channels since purchasing this box,POSITIVE
1289,This was very easy to use and set up and it's fun to have around the house,POSITIVE

1293,easy to use and navigate. controller is not complicated.,POSITIVE
1294,"I have been very hesitant of cutting that cable cord, but I decided to buy the Amazon Fire TV and test it out. I cut the cable cord the next day. Well worth the purchase and the savings from not having cable tv.",POSITIVE
1295,Great deal for a handy tablet. I have no complaints.,POSITIVE
1296,"As a standalone charger, this one does pretty good and I like the versatility to charge other items with the USB female plug vs. something hardwired that allows me to charge other USB-type devices in addition to something that uses a micro USB port.Charging time is faster for a Kindle Fire vs. my regular e-Ink Kindle charger, but since I haven't - and rarely - fully drain one of my Fires I cannot comment on the faster aspect for charging a Fire: I just know it works, and it does seem to charge my phone faster than the plug that came from Verizon. Thats not a shocker as this one is 9 watts vs. 5 for the normal charger.This is a replacement model to the original 9W PowerFast charger. Rather than the prior models square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and sticks out further from the socket. That seems to add more clutter to a wall socket. This years model also has rigid prongs (what you stick into the electrical socket) vs. the fold-down version of the prior model that gives it a lower profile. I didnt think too much of it at first, but the longer profile of the rectangular design, in addition to the electrical prongs not folding down into the charger, means it takes up a little bit more room in my laptop bag. Thats not good for me as now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and goes into the general pile of stuff that floats around in the main bag.19.99 seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size, and it is: despite my comments on the changes above, the PowerFast chargers Amazon makes do seem to last. Ive never had one break as other brands do, I just keep leaving them in random hotels and airports while traveling and have to buy another! If you are looking for a solid and longer-lasting charger for your tablet, I would recommend this one.",POSITIVE
1297,Brought this Tablet for a child and she loves it very much,POSITIVE
1298,It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright,MIXED
1299,Echo is the best way to have any songs (over a million) with just one command to Alexa. All the many features make for a wonderful piece of technology enjoyed by all ages. So helpful and entertaining!!!Love it!,POSITIVE

1313,I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn't sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I'm loving it!,POSITIVE
1314,"The old Fire TV's had an optical audio out S/PDIF, the new ones only have an HDMI output. Great if you have a new A/V setup that has HDMI pass-through on the receiver, not so good if you want to run video through HDMI and audio to your receiver.I should have probably considered a Roku.",NEGATIVE
1315,I cut the cord with cable and decided to try the Amazon Fire tv and it is amazing. Amazon Fire tv is the only box to offer basically all services. I did a lot of research and I am glad I went with this box!,POSITIVE
1316,Great for reading anytime of day. Size is perfect.,POSITIVE
1317,I am more interested in a reader not a tablet the one thing I don't like about this reader is I cannot make the font when reading large enough,NEGATIVE

1340,"It's so much fun to use, and helpful. Plays music, reports weather/traffic, even reads Wikipedia articles. Great item.",POSITIVE
1341,"Saw quite a few youtube videos on this product and thought it would be fun to have. We have it downstairs in a split level house and keep it downstairs. We should probably buy another one to keep upstairs! Works great. Voice recognition is superb. We use it to check traffic, play Pandora stations and answer various questions. Don't have any home automation stuff yet, but that may be next!",POSITIVE
1342,Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.,POSITIVE
1343,it does a lot LESS than you would expect. the advertisements is about all it does. no need to spend this large amount of money to listen to music you have on your phone. any info you get on the echo you get on your phone.,POSITIVE
1344,Great for ppl that use Amazon and Amazon products. The price was great to.,POSITIVE
1345,Great device. I purchased this for my uncle. I have the same device and it works great for our needs. I use it mainly for games and reading.,POSITIVE
1346,"My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help",POSITIVE
1347,"I was intrigued by this device and wanted to give it a try. I also have the Bose sound link mini and have to say the sound quality for music is better on the Bose if music is the sole reason for your purchase. For information and requesting a quick song or radio station, this thing rocks. You have to take time letting Alexa learn your voice but overall, the voice recognition is much better than Siri. My one complaint is that it doesn't sync with my Apple Calendar. Come on Amazon, cut a deal with Apple! Anyway, I give this a thumbs up and a 4 star rating. Get one. You won't have buyer's remorse.",MIXED
1348,Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend.,POSITIVE
1349,"This e reader is very lightweight, holds a charge for days and is easy to use. Be aware that the display is only black and white so books with pictures are not the best on here. Besides that it is great at reducing eye strain and the backlit screen makes for added versatility.",MIXED

1358,"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful.",POSITIVE
1359,This is my third Amazon Kindle and by far it is the best one. The adaptive lighting really helps as it is easy on the eyes. The battery lasts for weeks on a normal charge and charges to full pretty fast.I still enjoy the eink displays over a regular phone or tablet for extended reading periods.The kindle voyage is light weight and I was able to easily find cases and accessories online.I highly recommend the kindle voyage over the other kindle readers because of the advanced features.,POSITIVE
1360,"It has some cool uses when it comes to books, music and home controls. However it needs better capability for voice control and command.",MIXED
1361,Grandson loves his new tablet. Had to set him up as an adult because Amazon had too many restrictions for child account,POSITIVE
1362,This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.,POSITIVE

1367,"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel",POSITIVE

1378,Purchased as a gift for a family member who just wanted to be able to watch videos and play games while his wife shopped. Wonderful beginner tablet and no issues so far. Very user friendly.,POSITIVE
1379,This is the coolest technology I purchased since putting Windows 10 on my new laptop. I love being able to use the microphone to ask questions and request music. Combined with my sound bar they blow everyone away that comes to visit me.,POSITIVE
1380,Does a great job allowing me to watch shows i want to watch,POSITIVE
1381,"The Kindle Voyage is always with my in my purse. It is light, compact and easy to hold. I still love hard cover books but now I don't have to carry around the books from my book club. Some of the books I would rather not have to keep up with anyway. And, I can jump back and forth between stories.",POSITIVE

1411,"I purchased three of these tablets to give away at work. So, while I don't have any firsthand experience, I have asked my team how they liked them.It uses the Amazon app store (of course), which is fine but doesn't even compare to the Google Play store. Even though, there are a lot of options and most big apps (Netflix, hulu, etc.) are all supported.There is also removable storage. It is very nice to be able to add a memory card to expand your memory. This is a feature a lot of tablets stopped offering.All in all, these tablets are in expensive but more reliable and sturdy than other knock off tablets from different brands. Amazon made a great bargain tablet.",MIXED

1413,I bought one of these for me and my son. They are great tablets for the price. The resolution is great! Obviously you aren't getting the speed of a $600 or $700 tablet but I was surprised at how quick they were. I will continue to buy every new Amazon Fire tablet that comes out. You can't beat it for the price and you can upgrade every year if they make a new one. You could upgrade every year for more than 10 years for the price of one ipad.,POSITIVE
1414,"This little device is impressive. Easy to install and simple to navigate. I own both the Fire TV and the Fire Stick. The Fire TV is slightly quicker at responding to input, but not so much that it's a deal breaker. The Stick is great for taking with you on the road. Both devices are a great value. No complaints whatsoever.",POSITIVE

1421,"Originally I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds. They loved it and so did I. So many things to do on them and so much of what they love. I now got it as well for my 2 year old. The best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have 3 colors to choose from, so perfect for me.",POSITIVE
1422,"I have purchased several fire sticks through out my house, this one thus far as been the best. Loving the voice search it's like having siri on your tv.",POSITIVE

1427,Was bought for my 8 yr old who loves it to pieces!,POSITIVE
1428,"I have recently purchased a home, and I have been set on a mission to make my home as connected as possible. Finding the right product lineup has been interesting.However, the Alexa product was a no brainer. In our house we are Amazon Prime members, so we can take advantage of the music and 2-day shipping orders from Alexa. These are after thoughts, as I bought Alexa to control my smart home setup with my voice.Many believe you can just buy Alexa and control your home. This is not the case. You can use Alexa as a smart home hub with WeMo products, but this uses Wifi and the devices easily connect and disconnect throughout the day if not setup properly.In my setup, I have a Wink hub connected to z-wave products around the home. Wink can also connect to online services like Google's Nest Services and Chamberlin MyQ garage, but unfortunately they are not able to be directly controlled by Alexa for the Wink Hub.With that being said, for Z-Wave and Zigbee products, I can tell Alexa to turn on and off these products. As well as, if setup with a dimmer, what percentage to set them at. Often times this is quicker than the Wink app itself.Pros:Wink Compatible.Logitech Harmony Hub Compatible.Nest Compatible.IFTTT Compatible.Can read Audible Audio Books.Sound from speaker can fill a fair sized family room.Makes home automation more intelligent.Cons:Sometimes doesn't respond appropriately.Price is a bit high.To summarize, the Alexa functionality of this product is limited. Unless you have Amazon Prime or devices that can attach to it, using its enabled skills. Would recommend as an accessory to a smart home, or for someone invested in the Amazon Eco System.",POSITIVE
1429,While Alexa doesn't know all the answers to our questions she is surprisingly smart and is getting smarter. We haven't tapped into all her features yet choosing to savor each new discovery. We are very pleased and having a great time with our new family member.,POSITIVE
1430,Bought 2 for kids taking a long flight . It was perfect size for movies and games. Easy travel size,POSITIVE
1431,Got this for my daughter & grandson for their birthday.,NEUTRAL

1433,I bought this product for a 2 year old. It is easy enough for her to operate. She almost can operate it better than I can.,POSITIVE
1434,"I love the Echo. The speaker is good, and Alexa is very fast and efficient at answering queries and following instructions. I had the Echo less than a month before deciding to get an Echo Dot for my bedroom.",POSITIVE
1435,Picked this up a month ago and have been very happy with the purchase. Just installed smart light bulbs. Works perfectly!,POSITIVE
1436,"We've waited for the perfect Android tablet for our twin grand daughters and we finally found it. These are great for game play, surfing, learning, and growing with them. The display is amazing. Easy personalization out of the box. And it's through the Play Store. Awesome!",POSITIVE
1437,"I used to have the Amazon stick which I thought was good until I got my hands on the Amazon TV,Faster processor = less bufferingGreat picture qualityEndless choices for programmingIf you don't have one go get one you won't regret.Best Buy customer service in Signal Hill Ca 5 stars",POSITIVE
1438,"Got Fire tablet as an experiment. It was low cost and very compact but still and edge over my smart phone as far as screen size. Unit has worked flawlessly and has require minimum attention, but does a good job on email and recreational browsing.",POSITIVE
1439,I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps,POSITIVE
1440,does everything i need read lots of books from local library check out my email and facebook and hooks up nice to my wirelees,POSITIVE
1441,It's a great product to help make your home smarter & more convenient. Being able to set a timer while cooking or play a song without pulling out your phone. Being able to set up WiFi plugs to turn on lights in the house are also a plus.,POSITIVE
1442,overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice,POSITIVE

Whenever I get home from work, or I need to do chores around the house, ""Alexa, open Pandora."" Its super convenient and the speakers on it are amazing. I'm really impressed. If there was one thing though that I would have Amazon improve upon if they ever release a version 2 is to have the microphone distance be further than whatever it is at now, which seems to be about 10 feet or so.

I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't.

I love this machine but it also does become a little frustrating when it doesn't work immediately. In the time I've had it, it has mostly worked on the first try but there are definitely days when the lights won't all turn on when asked. Sometimes it takes a long time for Alexa to respond to the commands (Could be an internet issue, but still detracts from the experience).

1601,"How to do - not easy to find. Needs quick cheat sheet to accompany the product. I didn't think I'd like the back light but I do. I don't have a computer so it's hard to go on line. I'm not sure if I like how the books are arranged, but I'm slowly learning how to navigate around them. I had one of the original Kindles so changes are sometimes hard for us older people.",NEGATIVE
1602,"This is a review for the echo itself since you can't leave a review for it yet. I received my echo March 24, 2015 and i love it! I requested an invitation for it back in the beginning of December 2014. I got an email from Amazon a month later offering me the option to purchase it in January. I am a prime member so I purchased it for 99 right after I got that email. It said it would be shipped out around the first week of April. However in March I received an email saying they were able to ship it out earlier and they did. So I waited 3 months from the time I requested it. I'm so glad I bought it back then because the price for prime members is now 149. Anyways I personally love the Echo. My 3 daughters love it more then I do. I have a 9, 6, and a 2.5 yr old and they all kno how to use it. My little one tries to say Alexa play Mimi (Minnie mouse) so she can hear the Mickey mouse clubhouse theme song. I primarily got this for my daughters. One of them is dyslexic and the other 2 are on the spectrum. So they need help with doing homework. Alexa comes in so handy for this especially with spelling. My dyslexic daughter mixes up letters so this feature helps her tremendously. Also being able to voice command Alexa to play a song at any time, really comes in handy when I'm trying to redirect my daughters, when they are having a melt down. My youngest is obsessed with Mickey so if I say Alexa play hot dog, my 2 yr old will freeze and change her focus to the music. So for these features make me happy! Also the music plays very clear and loud in my opinion. I didn't have any problems with the app until today. It did seem off today. However they are always updating things so I don't know if that's what caused it to be different.Read more",POSITIVE

It froze after using it for about two years, give or take a couple of months. I've tried restarting it but it does not shut off. I advise you also buy the extended two year warranty or just go back to reading real books.",NEGATIVE
1630,Bought for my wife to be able to read outside. She love it and uses it all the time over her first generation kindle fire. Does not glare when using outside,POSITIVE
1631,"I love this little device. It's perfect for reading anywhere and anytime, especially great to use in the dark after my hubby is asleep. Most back lit devices hurt my eyes by this one doesn't bother them at all.",POSITIVE

1639,It should be in every home. Very easy to use and the speakers are excellent,POSITIVE
1640,"I bought this for my 3 year old, so she would have another option for watching her shows besides my iPad. Needless to say, she was too frustrated with the slowness to load the Netflix app, and it would only get internet if you were in the same room as the modem. You really do get what you pay for. If you buy this, don't count on getting online very seamlessly. The Internet browser is really slow to use, but you can get around this by downloading Google Play store to access the Firefox app, which is not offered on the Amazon App Store. Check YouTube for instructions..",MIXED
1641,"This is FANTASTIC! Alexa can hear ME clearly, even in a busy, NOISE filled room. With the TV blaring in the background , while watching a cricket match from across the room, I asked the question, she played the music I asked for. I love it.

1649,"This is so great, music, news, questions answered.",POSITIVE
1650,Love the Echo ! Awesome tone to the sound ! Very easy to use I can use this paired thru Bluetooth with my iPhone or I can simply ask Alexa questions. I can access my music from my Spotify or Spotify in general and various other sources. my only recommendation for new products would be to have this be able to be on the charger and then portable not connected to a Wall outlet like the smaller version can be on the charger. However I had the smaller version first and the tone quality and volume were not that great plus i had to get up go across the room to tap it to change anything or ask it anything. the echo you can just talk to it across the room which makes it really easy for you to be lazy ha ha:) I received this as a birthday gift and I really am enjoying it ...highly recommend it!,POSITIVE
1651,Not much can be added to the already substantial positive reviews. I bought both the Fire TV and Fire Stick so I'll comment on that. The Fire TV is much quicker and love the ability to run Ethernet and USB right to the unit. The Fire stick is great for our bedroom but this Fire TV is best for main TV viewing.,POSITIVE
1652,This is a great set top box with plenty of apps that will keep anyone engaged for hours!,POSITIVE
1653,Wag glad I purchased the Amazon Echo. Easy to set up and link with the two iPads in our home. Use it to play music from ITunes as well as the IPad.

Heartily recommend it to my friends and family.,POSITIVE

1669,Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around,POSITIVE
1670,Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.,POSITIVE
1671,Echo is a very interesting product. So far I just use it for listening to music. I ask it to play my old records from when was much younger. So far she knows them all.,POSITIVE

1673,Got it for my grandson and he really does like it.,POSITIVE
1674,"I had bought a Nabi for my granddaughter and she finally broke it. Out of warranty, I just fugured I'd purchase another one since she is familiar with it.

1676,This is great little tablet that is very user friendly and lightweight!,POSITIVE
1677,I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.,MIXED
1678,Heard about the Echo and had seen it on tv. Absolutely love the product. Very fun.,POSITIVE

1681,"We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.",NEGATIVE
1682,"This is my second tablet, but first based on android. This is their entry level tablet but still very responsive and snappy. The memory is upgradeable via memory card.",POSITIVE

1685,We bought this item to be a raffle prize for our Unions annual Holiday party. Winner was excited to get it. Black Friday week deals made it hard to pass up.,POSITIVE
1686,WHAT DID WE DO BEFORE ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY? I LOVE THE ECHO! THE SOUND AND FEATURES ARE AMAZING!,POSITIVE
1687,"I own all three of the latest Fire TV, Roku and Apple TV. Out of the three, as a pure streamer, I'd say Roku is probably my favorite followed by Apple TV and then Fire TV. However, as a multi-purpose device, the Fire TV wins hands down and it's not even close. The Fire TV allows you the most customization, freedom and versatility, such as the ability to side-load apps. Both Roku sand Apple TV are locked tight in that regard. Fire TV also features a more baked in Prime experience. The Fire TV can be a little slow sometimes and can freeze occasionally (more so depending on what you install), but overall, not a bad box for the price.",POSITIVE
1688,"I wasn't offer the warranty, but I enjoy it a lot.",MIXED
1689,Awesome little tablet for the price. Not an iPad but fine for just watching Netflix and other small tasks while on the go.,POSITIVE

1691,"The new Kindle Voyage is quite a step forward for the Kindle dedicated reader line. It is a beautiful device - almost like something from Apple.

1692,My kids adore their tablets! Best purchase ever!!!,POSITIVE
1693,"Easy to set up, sound not bad for a Kitchen Location. Use it everyday!",POSITIVE
1694,"If you want a tablet that is current and works well with the android platform and that you won't have a coronary when you kid drops on the floor, in the toilet, or anywhere then this is for you. We have 4 total and Amazon service if you have any issues is second to none. They even replaced previous ones for free when the charging port got loose but it seems that is now a problem of the past.",NEGATIVE
1695,Nice tablet for the price. Very easy to use and understand.,POSITIVE
1696,I wanted an inexpensive tablet that would allow me to surf the web and this was perfect! On top of it there are many other features that could be useful but you can't go wrong if you're just looking for the basics so purchase and enjoy.,POSITIVE

After moving the unit to another house, wasn't dfficult setting up on that network.Some reviewers said that the menu is too Amazon-centric. Does have a lot, but no problem downloading and using other streaming services (Crackle, YouTube, etc)4K: limited content, but quality seems okay on a 50"" 4k tv. Need a fast connection.Has an app- it could be better.If you don't need 4k, and have an iDevice house, Apple's box would be a more compatible choice...",MIXED

1721,"This is just the right size for someone who doesn't want to always use their phone while on the go. Must have wifi but that's not a problem. The response to the touch isn't bad at all.

However, after being @ a friends house for a BBQ and watching them use this for music, I decided to give it a try to see if it could replace my Sonos.It can't, however, I've found that I'm much more likely to play Spotify through this using voice controls if I'm in and out of a room for a shorter period of time and not near a Sonos to hit play/too busy to pull the phone out for Sonos app. This thing has also become more powerful as more IoT devices and services integrate with Echo or IFTTT. There is a TREMENDOUS amount of potential... give it a try and spend at least a week getting to know Alexa. You won't be sorry.",POSITIVE
1767,"We got this for my son foe Christmas. Loves it and keeps him entertained! It is user friendly for him for the most part and sturdy with the case it comes with. The only fault I see with this is in kids account. Before you load anything on to it, there are already tons of apps available to download as you please. I wish there was a way to have just the apps you choose to show up. I do also wish that there was a way to lock the screen, or app that he is playing at the time so little fingers don't get off the app accidently, he is only almost 2 though so I cant complain too much.

1819,"My wife was getting frustrated that she couldn't see the screen on her Nook Samsung Tab 4 when she would be on the beach or out in the sun, both places she wants to read. After comparing reviews of the Kindle and the Nook Glowlight Plus, she chose the Kindle and has been quite happy with the decision. She gets most of her books from our library with Overdrive and has had no problem with downloading them from Amazon. The Kindle is light and holds and feels like a book. She added a cover off Amazon so it turns on and off when it is opened/closed. She likes being able to read out on our deck or in the sunroom just as easily as she does inside.",POSITIVE
1820,I got this tablet for my niece because while she was visiting with me her tablet that she brought with her stopped working. I got online and searched for an inexpensive tablet that would do the same thing that her non working tablet would do and so I searched and ran upon this tablet and this is it plus more!!!!,POSITIVE
1821,"I purchased this item, along with an HD antenna to finally cut the cable. Prices were getting out of control with the cable monopoly. This product really delivers. All the entertainment you could possibly want at your fingertips. I use it to stream PlayStation Vue. After experimenting with all devices. I feel this is by far the best. As smooth as a PS4, but easier to navigate with the remote. I also use it to stream Netflix as well as some of the free content. Overall an easy to use great product",POSITIVE
1822,Its a Kindle with Amazon and for only $40. Its a win regardless its for yourself or a gift for family.,POSITIVE
1823,"I got what I paid for. At this price point, there is no arguing that this is value for money. Great for accessing amazon content though my toddler finds it great streaming videos as well.",POSITIVE
1824,"It's fast, content is great and as long as no HDR isn't an issue, it's a great alternative to the Shield at half the price.",POSITIVE
1825,It's cool but it's kind of slow. I don't feel it's worth $119. Maybe like 70,MIXED
1826,"I will rate this Amazon Tap a five stars when the application to make the Alexa commands become remote, instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself.",MIXED
1827,"Good for streaming off internet , no buffering on Lodi and live tv !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",POSITIVE
1828,The Fire TV as opposed to the stick allows you to watch HD with no issues whatsoever. It has the capacity to download all your favorite apps including Crossy Road. Definitely would recommend to a friend.,POSITIVE
1829,This reader is perfect for my needs. It is light weight and very easy to hold. Books are easily downloaded and sync with my iPad and iPhone. I would recommend purchasing a cover.,POSITIVE
1830,"Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for. Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality.",POSITIVE
1831,"Easy to use, clear and accurate and very entertaining.",POSITIVE
1832,Love my Kindle Paperwhite. Love that you can read it outdoors.,POSITIVE

1838,"Very good product to have at home, comes in handy and makes life a bit easier",POSITIVE
1839,Just like the title...fast and perfect together with amazon prime (you don't need to have amazon prime to use this player),POSITIVE
1840,"I really like the smaller size reader, and being left handed the ease of use of the haptic page turn buttons are very easy to use. I don't even use the touch screen page advance any more, with the haptic advance this can be done from the right or left side of the reader, an advantagefor us lefties. This is my fourth kindle, I keep upgrading due to all the changes and advances, I use my kindle every night and enjoy it very much and would highly recommend if you want to upgrade to the voyage, visit your local best buy and hold it in your hands and feel and see the difference.",POSITIVE

1847,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books.",MIXED
1848,"The kindle fire 10 is a major upgrade from the original fire. My kids, 8 and 11, referred to it as an IPad when it was first received.",POSITIVE
1849,"Great for playing music, finding out the weather forecast, etc. still learning all the options available.",POSITIVE
1850,"I purchased it for a gift but i have to do all the up keep and maintaining. I've been a long time prime member who has many kindle books. I see this can be good for reading out side, it's lighter than a tablet and you don't have to charge it alot, the battery lasts a long time...Setup is straight forward and doesnt take alot of instruction to use it. It displays adds while its off, but it didn't bother me at all. It took me but a few minutes to setup and learn how to use the device.If you have prime you should see all your books right away but If you don't have prime but have someone in your house that does you have to setup a household and share everything to my wife so she was able to see all the books that i had purchased (i can be selective after they are shared). One thing i noticed was there is the kindle lending library, it only allows 1 book to be borrowed per month. Recently Amazon came up with Prime Reading, so you can take out multiple books at a time but you have to do it thru the web or a tablet or phone using the kindle app, which after they are taken out the kindle will see.",POSITIVE
1851,"This is a nice item to get especially when your husband is a movie buff. It will allow you to go to extended channels in order to watch whatever taste you may have for watching TV.. It allows you watch all kinds of sports from soccer, to football, to baseball to lacrosse, to whatever interests you.",POSITIVE
1852,Good size for reading and screen is easy to read. Even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around,POSITIVE
1853,"Echo is a nice addition to my ahem becoming automated home (not close). What I like with it are easy to use and setup, there still a lot of improvement to do but overall it's nice to have it as long the maker of it will continue to update Alexa to keep up with.this fast paced technology of us.",POSITIVE
1854,My daughter gave me a google for Christmas but I returned it because I wanted an echo. Love it!!!,POSITIVE
1855,This is my first tablet. It's very user friendly. Like the parental controls on it. So my kids can use it.,POSITIVE
1856,"Super easy to use and very gentle on your eyes, I've tried many e-readers but I'll definitely stick to this one.",POSITIVE
1857,Very comfortable to read from - doesn't give off a bright light if reading at light. Doesn't strain eyes,POSITIVE
1858,Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for.,POSITIVE
1859,"Nice, sleek design, works well, at least so far:)!",POSITIVE
1860,Amzon tap is great and fun Bluetooth speaker with inbuilt Alexa. I can talk it to end of the room and it can still understand my commands and plays music. Cool device and I highly recommend it.,POSITIVE
1861,"Great sound quality and very sleek to fit into any room dcor. Due to the price reduction during the holidays, I ranked it a 5 versus a 4 if the regular price was applicable to my purchase. Satisfied enough to purchase two Amazon Dots for my family as Christmas stuffers...which they loved.",POSITIVE
1862,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home.,POSITIVE
1863,Pleased with Alexa. Finding information easily accessible and fun to gather. Would highly recommend.,POSITIVE
1864,"Echo does exactly as advertised. It will tell you the weather, jokes and some fun facts. using the skills you can add different features and for the most part they work. For it to really be big it has to continue to add features that the everyday user has an interest in. If you don't get the wording just right echo will not carry out the command. in the skills set you always have to start with a common phrase to get it to understand. This could be a pain because if you forget the exact phrase it will not work. Overall a great product well made and has great potential to be the star of the home automation.",MIXED
1865,This has been a great addition to our home. We love using it to play music and getting general information.,POSITIVE
1866,"Wife loves it! Great sound, great technology! Compact and durable.",POSITIVE

1872,Spiffy toy and ad they add more items to control it will become even better,POSITIVE
1873,This thing is pretty freakin cool. It's a gadget but a useful one. It's literally Siri for the house. Ask it anything and get the answer or just listen to any type of music in great sound quality. Awesome little thing.,POSITIVE
1874,Great gift as it's reasonably priced. Battery life is fantastic. Put it into airplane mode and it lasts even longer. Don't forget this is the one where you have to adjust the backlight. If you want to auto adjust you need to get the Voyager. Both nice and compact. Highly recommended.,POSITIVE
1875,I currently have two fire TVs in my home. Prior to this I had an apple TV which was the one before the newest generation of 2016. It became obsolete with slow streaming speeds all the time. After purchasing the Fire TV I can honestly say its the best bargain in town. The price is just right and has not been an issue in speed or clarity for streaming all your favorite movies shows. The ease of use is also a big plus. I highly recommend if you are on the fence.,POSITIVE
1876,I've always been a fan of kindles but this one is the perfect size and weight to store in my bag. I'm very satisfied with this product #teamkindlepaperwhite.,POSITIVE
1877,"This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology.",POSITIVE

1880,This was a good proce and does what it needs too for the price!,POSITIVE
1881,This item is a must if you have a Amazon Prime Membership!,POSITIVE
1882,"Bought this because my old Galaxy Tab 10 has become old and slow. Very pleased with the Fire tablet, quickly loaded books, magazine subscriptions and easily taps into my Amazon Prime subscription - video and music. Only reason it gets 4 stars versus 5 is the annoying ad on the lock screen (although I'm sure that's why the device is so cheap).",MIXED
1883,This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!,POSITIVE
1884,I am really enjoying being able to read books online that are downloaded from the public library. I have read 5 books in the last few weeks now that I can use the public library system to access book titles. No more buying books at the bookstore,POSITIVE
1885,Easy to use. Great for someone who wants to play some games and use simple apps.,POSITIVE
1886,Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.,POSITIVE
1887,"For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve.",MIXED
1888,"Love it, especially the ability to stream Prime Music.",POSITIVE
1889,"My Echo is such a helpful assistant! She turns the lights on and off, tells me the weather, plays my favorite music, finds recipes, wakes me when I set an alarm, and helps me relax and sleep with meditation music. I have one in the living room and a a Dot in the bedroom.",POSITIVE
1890,"This was a Christmas present for our 8 year-old. It is perfect for kids. It was inexpensive, but it still gives him access to games and educational apps. Much to his dismay, we limit his screen time, but he really enjoys this product.",POSITIVE
1891,I bought this for my wife. She loves it. Pictures taken with the camera are OK but not the greatest.,MIXED
1892,This Echo is amazing!! I love waking up and not having to use a remote or get out of bed.. she does a lot.. and the names are perfect Alexa or Amazon.. but it's a great speaker loud..,POSITIVE
1893,"Love this device. I have a 16 month old that is hard set to get to nap and go to bed. Currently still on a vacation, and have been very pleased with the ease of putting on Sesame Street on the hotel tv via hbogo. no little tablet or phone needed, and has perfect picture quality",POSITIVE
1894,This is a good tablet for my daughter. Does everything she needs it to do.,POSITIVE
1895,"I love the color is choose,and the tablet is great",POSITIVE
1896,"Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc.",POSITIVE
1897,"I really like it, it's working out quite well for me wish I had bought one a lot sooner",POSITIVE
1898,"I love my kindle voyage. I get distracted when I read on my tablet, so I decided to purchase an eReader. I am very happy I did! I hope to meet my reading challenge now!",POSITIVE
1899,Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Very user friendly,POSITIVE
1900,"We're an unplugged family - multiple devices (Kindles, iPads, Roku, etc.) - so we're pretty familiar with this sort of tech. Fire TV works okay, but the remote has started giving me problems and we've only had the product for about 6 months. Our Roku 3, which we've had for over a year, is much smoother and hasn't given us any problems. We also use a Chromecast, which also seems to be less quirky than the FireTV. I have a PS3 in the same room as the FireTV and I find myself going to the PS3 when the FireTV starts to annoy. Unless you're looking for a device that can also run Kodi, I'd strongly recommend the Roku 3 over the FireTV.",MIXED
1901,This item is exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect size for home or travel. It is very loud for its size.,POSITIVE
1902,The other kids got the kids fire but this is comparable.,NEGATIVE
1903,It is an awesome tablet. I purchased one for my granddaughter for Christmas.,POSITIVE
1904,Couldn't be happier for what Alexa offers. Good Product.,POSITIVE
1905,It is simple and easy to use. Easy set up. I have a Firestick and Fire TV and this has a nicer interface.,POSITIVE

1908,Bought as a gift for my kids. Great device. Kids love it.,POSITIVE
1909,Easy to use and lots of fun. Was easy to purchase.,POSITIVE
1910,"If you actually paid 20 for this adapter, you're out of your mind.",NEGATIVE
1911,"I like the convenience of my Kindle a lot for reading, and the process for buying books from Amazon is easy and flawless, as well as cheaper than buying physical books. There are a lot of $1.99 specials of very good books. I just wish the Kindle was slightly larger - more the size of a typical paperback book - because when I'm reading it feels like I'm ""turning"" a page every few seconds.",MIXED
1912,This is a fantastic product. Picture quality is awesome. Increased our internet speed so hardly an buffering. Much faster than the stick.,POSITIVE
1913,I got rid of cable for this and trust and believe it is worth it.,POSITIVE
1914,The Kindle's keep getting better and better. I purchased this for my son who is an avid reader. He loves it and I love that he is reading more.,POSITIVE
1915,"Easy to set up and use. We use her all the time to set alarms, check weather turn lights on and off, listen to music, etc. I liked it so much I bought one for my Mom and Brother for Christmas.",POSITIVE

1918,Bought for my kids for Christmas. Great tablet for the price!,POSITIVE
1919,"I have the Kindle Fire HD, so when i bought this i expected something up to that caliber or better. Sadly, it did not. In my opinion the older one is better in sound quality. The new one is lighter, but I did pay less for it.",NEGATIVE
1920,Cool item. Also purchased the Dot to use upstairs. Very convenient verses finding/picking up the phone. Love the daily Jeopardy questions.,POSITIVE
1921,This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.,POSITIVE
1922,Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.,POSITIVE
1923,I bought 3 of these. They are great and very durable . . The price is amazing .,POSITIVE
1924,It's a great product the sound quality is amazing.. would recommend this to all my friends,POSITIVE
1925,I have both the FIRESTICK and AMAZON TV. I choose to to get the AMAZON TV for better streaming and live channels. Thus far I am satisfied.,POSITIVE
1926,"I bought for my dad who is open to smart technology but still a newbie. He found it is wasy to set up and discovering more uses for it. He's satisfied, so am I!",POSITIVE
1927,I think it's a awesome device if you like tok stream.,POSITIVE
1928,"Not many negative things to say. It's solid, and comes with a lot of preloaded content. Sign in with your Amazon account email and you're set. Use a USB dongle and wireless keyboard to really streamline your input, in case the voice command leaves you frustrated.",POSITIVE
1929,"Light weight, charge lasts for upto a week and can read pretty much anytime of the day indoor or outdoor ... very happy to have this e-reader",POSITIVE
1930,"I just use it as a new phone charger for my android, you need to buy this if you buy a Kindle because the USB they come with doesn't have this attached.",NEUTRAL
1931,"i bought this for my niece and she seems to love. It was easy to set up, but a little different to navigate from other android devices. she mainly uses it for netflix, but sometimes i catch my sister player finding nemo on it.",MIXED
1932,Was over a friends house and they had one so I decided to get one. This is awesome.,POSITIVE
1933,Grandkids love it! It's very easy for them to use. They enjoy reading and playing games!!!,POSITIVE
1934,"I have a Fire tablet like this, so I knew my granddaughter would love it!",POSITIVE
1935,"This reader is purely for the person that simply wants an e-book reader, and very little else.",POSITIVE
1936,Excellent device. Great for reading on the go.reading settings for more than one reader.,POSITIVE
1937,"I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it.",MIXED
1938,Great tablet for the price. My granddaughter loves how user friendly it is.,POSITIVE
1939,We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.,MIXED
1940,So far so good. Having an issue with one of them freezing. Might have to use it,POSITIVE
1941,Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader.,POSITIVE
1942,The Fire TV itself is great for streaming various media over our wireless network to our TV in our sun room. At first we thought we'd have to get an extender but we got lucky and everything runs pretty smoothly. The applications are fast and responsive and the menus are easy enough to navigate for the young one in the house. The only thing we aren't happy with is that the remote chews through batteries pretty quickly. I have a Logitech Harmony remote that has a LCD screen on it and it doesn't go through batteries as fast the Fire TV remote. We now remove the batteries whenever the remote is not in operation. An annoyance but not a deal breaker.,MIXED
1943,Was happy to use this to take my commutes entertainment to the next level,POSITIVE
1944,I got this for my mom. I have a Kindle and there are always free games available for it but not for the tablet she had so i got it for her and download a bunch of games for it. The only problem is the games seem to drain the battery fairly quickly,MIXED
1945,"A bit difficult to get working with other smart home devices. After Some trial and error with my smart things hub, and IFTT commands it works great. Would increase to five star review if it was a bit easier to get up and running.",MIXED
1946,My daughter loves this; she is reading voraciously,POSITIVE
1947,You get a multitasking tablet for an incredible price!,POSITIVE
1948,"I use Alexa all the time to set temperature, water the lawn, play music. This is definitely a product worth having if you have a smart home.",POSITIVE
1949,Bought it for my mom and she loves it. Easy to use.,POSITIVE
1950,"Love the Echo! Listen to music, weather, and my shopping list!",POSITIVE
1951,This is the best tablet to get for the amount of money you will spend. It has everything you need. Maybe not the best camera but I phone for that.,POSITIVE
1952,I purchased 2 of this Amazon Tablet for my 2 kids - 4 & 3yrs old.They just can't keep there eyes off this they fondly call IPAD.My wife laugh every day when they tell her to recharge their IPAD.,POSITIVE
1953,Tablet runs well and the form factor is decent for such a cheap tablet.,POSITIVE
1954,My daughters love it it is probably one of the best tablets ive ever bought,POSITIVE
1955,"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again.",POSITIVE
1956,"I wanted one for quite a while, caught it in Dale and I am very pleased with it. The battery lasts longer than my kindle touch from several years being able to adjust the back ground light makes reading enjoyable in low light. Glad I bought it",POSITIVE
1957,"I had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the Kindle Voyage. But the only difference between the two is the design, page press buttons and the auto dimming light as they both have the same screen. After purchasing this device, I immediately devoured three books in the course of a weekend. Which, sadly, is more than I've read in about two years. This device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while. I would suggest that you get the genuine leather cover for this device when you buy it as it just adds that little extra to the purchase. Overall, I would recommend anyone that wants to read more, reads often, or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device. Plus, new books can be upwards of $20-$30 sometimes. This little device will carry all of your books and only costs the price of a few hard copy books. Plus if you need a physical copy, you can always borrow from the library.",MIXED
1958,"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories.",MIXED
1959,Awesome price on Black Friday! Great tablet for reading and searching the Internet. Has expandable memory slots which is great!,POSITIVE
1960,This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.,MIXED
1961,This is my second Echo that I use mostly as a Bluetooth speaker for a PC.Great sound quality for the price.,POSITIVE
1962,"I compared this with the google home for a few weeks. We like that we can add items to our joint gmail calendar and add items to our shopping list with ease. Not a fan that you need amazon prime to play any song you want, but syncing other music sources are pretty easy and make up for this. It lacks asking for facts that google home tends to answer with more ease. We are adding automated lighting this week, looking forward to seeing how this works. Hope they keep upgrading it to keep adding new automation devices. Pretty fun and useful tool it has proven to be. Just added an echo dot for upstairs too. Also to note, adding the Alexa and Any.DO app to our iPhones has helped improve the usefulness of the device also",MIXED
1963,Like my tablet very much. Camera good to learn with.,POSITIVE
1964,"The 7"" Amazon Kindle Fire is the best starter tablet on the market, which I have purchased and gave a presents to high school and college graduates...",POSITIVE
1965,"This was recommended to me. Good product, can avail Amazon prime and will automatically get hook up & have an access to it.",POSITIVE
1966,This is a great product and it runs Android so you can install Kodi.,POSITIVE

1969,This item is a great product. Let's me use it for different things.,POSITIVE
1970,This is a great tablet for the price! Will definitely buy again,POSITIVE
1971,"The echo is a great item with lots of compatibility for the smart products I bought, and is also good at being a decent radio/music player when I'm bored.",POSITIVE
1972,The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it!,POSITIVE
1973,"Holds a charge, easy to use, all in all great tablet.",POSITIVE
1974,"This device has a nice front & back camera, screen",POSITIVE
1975,Got the echo and was so happy with it got the dot. Then moved up to the smart home bulbs and now Alexa turns on my lights. Moving to thermostat next,POSITIVE
1976,"Easy to install, just requires internet connection. If you have an amazon prime account you have access to all kinds of movies and shows like a hulu or netflix account would work. There are also apps that you can download and purchase that will alllow you to watch other shows and even play games. Since installing the firestick we have gotten rid of one cable box because we can just watch so many other things on the firestick and have helped cut down on our bills. Who doesn't like saving money?",POSITIVE
1977,I was concerned it would be difficult to set up. Turned out very easy to set up and to use.,POSITIVE
1978,"Set up was Extreamly easy. Hooks up well with other products like TrackR, Nest and Phillips Hue. Most of all my wife gets all her songs by just asking for them. When she forgets where her phone is she simply ask it to have TrackR ring her phone and when she's cold or hot she just asks for it to be warmer or cooler.",POSITIVE
1979,"My child is having the time of their life, great for small hands.",POSITIVE
1980,Fantastic option for those fed up expensive unnecessary cable and satellite services.,POSITIVE
1981,Amazing product and very useful I love it !! I recommend,POSITIVE
1982,Great tablet my son loves it and everything about it. He loves playing the games and this tablet is very very fast!,POSITIVE
1983,This was a good investment. That being said do yourself a favor and buy a SD Micro card and add it on before you download anything. Makes it run that much smoother,POSITIVE
1984,"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services.",NEGATIVE

1999,I have this and the dot. Very little difference between the two other than size. Maybe it plays music a little louder thanks to bigger speaker but if this wasn't on sale I would've stuck with the Echo Dot. 4 stars because of the functionality of Alexa product in general,MIXED
